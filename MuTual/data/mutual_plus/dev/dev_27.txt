F: Is this a round trip? Will you need a return to get to? M: Yes, and check that for thirty-first in the evening. F: Let me see, uh, there's a non-stop flight to Paris from Kennedy Airport on twenty-fourth at 6:00 am. On thirty-first you may board flight 309, which is at 4:30 pm. But it will stop for about 4 hours in London before it returns to New York. M: OK, fine. I think that can work for me. F: Would you like to book the tickets then? M: Yes, I'd like a business class ticket. What's the cost? F: It will be $2,750. Will you pay by card or in cash? M: Neither. Do you accept checks? F: Yes, we do. M: OK, I prefer a window seat.
