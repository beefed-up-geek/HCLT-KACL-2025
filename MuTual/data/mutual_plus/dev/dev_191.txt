Thank you for answering some questions and for signing our customers books. F: No problem. I love meeting the people who read my books. M: So how did you think of the idea for this book? F: About 4 years ago, I was taking my dog for a walk. When I saw a very beautiful bird, I started thinking about birds and decided to read about them at the library. I became very interested in birds, and that's how I decided to create the main character in my book. He is a scientist who studies birds. M: How long did it take you to write the book? F: I wrote the book in about 2 years. I only spent 3 months thinking of the story, but it took much longer to write it. M: Do you ever worry you won't be able to think of another idea for a book? F: All the time, but I always think of more ideas as soon as I finish with the book I'm writing. Reading the newspaper helps me think of ideas. Taking long showers also helps me think of ideas.", "id": "dev_191"}
