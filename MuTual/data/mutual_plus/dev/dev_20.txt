M: Yes, the runs take place in the countryside. The areas like the Lake District in the Highlands of Scotland are very popular. But this doesn't stop people from the city taking part. For example, I drive to my club for my city apartment. F: Can you tell me the history of mountain running? M: Well, there are records of people doing this going back nearly 1000 years. It was always been connected with country fairs and festivals. Overtime it became official, and nowadays a run is operated usually on its own. F: Hmm, what are the tougher courses like? M: There is a race called the Dragons Back, which takes place over 5 days and over a distance of 200 miles. But before you sign up for it, I should point out that only people with lots of experience are allowed to enter. F: How can you get started in the sport? M: Well, you start with something easy and work your way up to more challenging runs. If you want to enter races, you'll find their graded in terms of distance and height. But just as people who do road running won't necessarily run a marathon, you don't have to enter mountain running races.", "id": "dev_20"}
