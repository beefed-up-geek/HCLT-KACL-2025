You spoke so rapidly that I did not catch the meaning of what you said. Could you repeat that?", "M: You mean there's a faster bus? I didn't know. Maybe I will try next time, as you said. This time's 16 hours is really uncomfortable.", "M: Really? I have no idea that I don't look well. It seems that I need some rest."], "article": "F: Hey. Welcome to Berlin. It's great to see you again. M: Yeah, good to see you, too. Have you been waiting here at the station long? F: Only 15 minutes. But let's get out of this cold and go to my apartment. How are you feeling after that long bus ride? M: Ah, it wasn't too bad. It was only 19 hours. F: That's crazy. You could have flown here from London, for 60 euros and it would only have taken an hour and a half. Was it really worth all that time just to save a bit of money? M: Well, it was a pretty uncomfortable ride. To be honest, the bus was starting to smell toward the end of it. And there was a man next to me, who was breathing really loudly while he was sleeping. But the reason I took the bus was because it's more environmentally friendly than flying. F: I think it's great we want to help the environment. But you look so tired right now. I just think you should be a little more careful with your health.", "id": "dev_485"}
