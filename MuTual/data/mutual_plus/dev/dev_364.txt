F: I work in a restaurant. M: Then you must know about how people tip very well. I came to this country just last week. I really don't know how to tip. Yesterday ordered a five dollar 95 cent beer, I gave the waitress $6. 00 and asked her to keep the change. She didn't give me a happy look. F: Well, you tipped too little. You should have left at least a 15% tip. That's a regular tip. M: Oh, I really tipped too little last time. Have you received such a low tip before? F: Sure. Some customers just leave such a low tip on purpose. What's worse, they expect quick service. It's really hard to accept. M: How do most people tip? F: Most people tip a 15% tip, but some tip 20% or even higher. M: Those must be your favorite kinds of customers. F: Sure. I am saving money for a car, so I really need better tips.", "id": "dev_364"}
