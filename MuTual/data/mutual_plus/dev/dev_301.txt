You were supposed to turn left on Wilson Blvd. M: Oh, I'm sorry. Did you say 1323 Wilson? F: No 3023. It is OK though, you don't have to take me there, I can walk from here. M: I can just make a U turn and so one way street. See the sign up ahead? Maybe if I turn left here, I can come down the next street. F: We can't do that during the rush hour. Really, though it won't be much trouble, sometimes one can wait 30 minutes for a taxi. So I'm happy to get this close.", "id": "dev_301"}
