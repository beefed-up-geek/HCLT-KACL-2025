M: Who wants that you're talking about? F: I was just reading an article about some people who helped a homeless person in New York city. Well, the homeless person was a 33 year old man from an Eastern European country, he had come to the US in September, looking for work. Not only couldn't he find any but he also fell asleep at a bus station and was robbed of everything he owned. For about a month, the poor guy had to live in homeless shelters and beg for food. One day he met a group of people in a park. They were from a local clothing store that was giving away shirts and pants to homeless people. When they found out about the young man's problems, they immediately took him to a hotel. Gave him a hot meal and found a way to buy him a plane ticket back to his country.", "id": "dev_314"}
