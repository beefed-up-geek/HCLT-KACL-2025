I hated it and I didn't have any friends there. However, I saved money and I learned how to work hard. M: Mom, I really don't have time to work this summer. I am going to go to summer school and I need to practice skateboarding. Also I want to go to the lake with Jeremy. F: Well. How are you going to pay to go to the lake? You are getting too old for us to give you money. You're not a young kid anymore. Also, college is very expensive these days. You should start saving money now. College is only 3 years away. M: OK, I'll apply for some jobs this weekend. Can you help me fill out job applications? F: Yes, I will help you, you should get an application from the supermarket on Walnut Street. Miss Jacobs told me they are hiring students this summer.", "id": "dev_287"}
