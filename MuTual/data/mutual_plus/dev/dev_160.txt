F: That's a great idea Joe, which sport do you want to play? M: I'm not sure, which one I'd be good at. I can run really fast, but I'm not very good at throwing or catching a ball. F: Um, well, you probably shouldn't play baseball or football then, and you wouldn't be very good at basketball either. M: Is there a swim team? Maybe I'd be better at that. F: We were supposed to have a swim team this year. But we didn't get enough money. I'm sorry Joe. M: Oh well, I guess I can find something else to do. Thanks for your advice. F: No problem, maybe we can look at the different clubs on campus you could join instead. Can you come back to see me after class? I'll be in the school volunteers office.", "id": "dev_160"}
