I've been waiting for 2 hours. F: Sorry, we landed on time, but I couldn't exit the airplane with everyone else. M: Why not? F: Security stopped me. Just before we landed, a little girl dropped her backpack in my seat when I went to brush my teeth. I guess the flight attendant couldn't figure out whose it was and called security.
