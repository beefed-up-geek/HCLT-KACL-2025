M: Hi, it's great to see you, been waiting long? F: No, not at all. What do you want to have? M: Just a salad, so how's the new apartment working out? F: Good, I like it. The neighborhood, though, is... Well, some of the buildings down the street are covered with terrible pictures drawn by teenagers. M: I know what you mean. I think we need to report people who are drawing to the police. F: Yes, and I like all the stores. It's convenient for shopping, and it's pretty quiet at night. That's definitely a plus. M: Sounds like you're pretty satisfied. F: Yeah, I guess so, uh the only problem is that it's impossible to find parking. I have to drive around the block 6 or 7 times to find a space, usually I can't find a space usually I can find one, but sometimes I have to park really far away. M: Well, is there anyway, you can rent space in a garage. F: Yeah, that's a good idea. So now are things in your neighborhood. M: There's a bit of noise problem where I live. I live right down the street from a school. The bell rings every morning at 7:30, it's impossible to sleep in.", "id": "dev_106"}
