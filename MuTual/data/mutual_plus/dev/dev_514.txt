M: What do I like to do on Sunday? Well, I think it's changing every Sunday. I like to go to concerts or things like that on a sunny day. And I like to go to the cinema, too. I like to stay home when it rains, like last weekend. And I don't go out when it's too windy. F: Well. I like reading new novels and going shopping. What time do you usually get up on Sunday? M: Well, quite late I guess, about 10 o'clock. It's not really late, but late enough. F: I'm an early riser, usually at 6 or 7 o'clock. What do you normally eat for breakfast on Sunday morning? M: I guess the same thing as everyday like eggs and bread. F: Ah, no difference. You never cook? M: No. I like spending my time doing things like writing music. So I don't. I mean, I care what I eat. But I don't spend a lot of time preparing, so I basically eat the same thing every morning.", "id": "dev_514"}
