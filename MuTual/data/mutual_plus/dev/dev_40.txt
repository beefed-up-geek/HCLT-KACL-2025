F: Not much, just catching up on a TV show I like to watch. Sometimes it's nice to come home after a long day at work and relax. M: I know what you mean. In fact, I wouldn't mind some relaxation time myself. F: You look like you had a long day, too. Did you just get home from work? M: No, I just returned home from an overseas business trip. I spent the last 24 hours in airports, and on airplanes. Luckily, I have the next 2 days off, it's a rare opportunity. F: So what are you going to do, since you finally have time to yourself? M: When I can I like to go to the beach. I go for a swim, dry off and lay in the sun with a good book to read. F: That sounds very peaceful, it's nice to be alone sometimes. Of course, there is nothing better than hanging out with your friends. M: That's true, actually if you're not doing anything tomorrow. You could come out with me and my friends we're going to have lunch, and then go see a movie. F: I would love to, I don't work tomorrow either. M: Great, well, I'll let you watch your TV show and I'll go to my room to send some emails to my boss. F: Don't be silly, you work too hard. Sit down and watch the show with me, relax. M: I guess that's the best thing to do.", "id": "dev_40"}
