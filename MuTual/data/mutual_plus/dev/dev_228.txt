So I can call your co-worker someday.", "F: I am afraid I did not quite catch what you were saying. Please repeat it.", "F: Don't forget to call your boss Mr. Godfrey. He has something urgent to tell you."], "article": "M: So is there any other area I should look at as well? Yes, I'd recommend West Derby. That will be closer to your office. F: That sounds good. M: Yes, and if you have children, it also has very good schools. F: That's not my concern. I live on my own so I'm only looking for a cheap single room, something like a flat. M: Umm, that may be a problem here in this area then, because there are mostly larger houses here. You'd probably be able to share one with other people who want to rent though. F: No, I'm only interested in flats at the moment. M: We actually have another office in South Derby, and the guy who works there is a really good friend of mine.
