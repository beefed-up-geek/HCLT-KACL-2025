Another term paper? M: No no, this is easy compared to that. My cousin is coming on Thursday. She has an interview at the college and I promised my odd I'd look after her. We're going to the game on Friday. But on Saturday I'm on duty at the library all day and can't get out of it. Uh I was wondering if you could show her around during the day and maybe we can all meet for dinner later? F: Sure. I don't have any plans. What kind of things does she like to do? M: Actually, I haven't seen her for 3 years. She lives so far away, but this will be her first time on a college campus. She is still in high school so she probably enjoys anything on campus.", "id": "dev_324"}
