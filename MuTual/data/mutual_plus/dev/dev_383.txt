For today's program, we have invited Sophie, a lady, who worked as a nurse during World War 2. F: Good evening. At the beginning of World War 2, the government called on all its citizens 18 years old and over to help out. I started training as a nurse in November 1940. It was 2 months of being taught basic skills in the school of nursing. M: What happened to you during the sudden attack, you know when Nazi Germany dropped bombs on Britain? F: Manchester was bombed on the twenty-second and twenty-third of December 1940. On December twenty-forthth, I received an order requesting my immediate return from leave for duties of nursing the wounded. Many volunteers in the Manchester social services have taken a week's leave for the Christmas holidays. So the Manchester city rest centers were short of staff. Christmas Day was therefore my first day of nursing.", "id": "dev_383"}
