M: Well, not really. I still have to buy some clothes. It's winter there. F: Is it very cold there? M: While the weather doesn't get too cold but it often snows in the mountains. So I'm going to buy a couple of warm sweaters, a jacket and a hat. I don't have room in my suitcase to pack a coat. So I'm going to wait until I get there and buy it when I really need it. F: Do you need any clothing for formal occasions? M: Well, I guess so, you never know when you might need something for a party or a nice date. So I'll probably take a suit.
