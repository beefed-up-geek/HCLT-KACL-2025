Yes, I'd recommend West Derby. That will be closer to your office. F: That sounds good. M: Yes, and if you have children, it also has very good schools. F: That's not my concern. I live on my own so I'm only looking for a cheap single room, something like a flat. M: Umm, that may be a problem here in this area then, because there are mostly larger houses here. You'd probably be able to share one with other people who want to rent though. F: No, I'm only interested in flats at the moment. M: We actually have another office in South Derby, and the guy who works there is a really good friend of mine. His name is John Godfrey. F: Could you tell me his telephone number? M: It's 074263951. F: Great. Is there a good time to call him? I'm here for a whole week until Sunday tenth. M: I'm sure he'll be able to see you on Saturday. F: That sounds fine.
