Good luck!", "M: Now I feel nervous hearing you saying the test will be surprisingly difficult."], "article": "M: Hi, Jeannie, why have you come to school an hour early? F: I wanted to get a front row seat and review one more time before the test, because I failed a course last term. Why you here so early, Jack? M: I get out of my car here at this time everyday. You seem to be nervous about your lessons. Have you finished your review? F: I've only been studying night and day for the last week. If I don't get an A in this class, I won't get the support of my country. Why do you seem so calm? M: This class is really just a review for me. I've been learning it for 2 years. F: That's lucky for you. M: Jeannie, can you guess what the test will be like? Will it be difficult? F: I hope not, but I'm still worried about it.", "id": "dev_394"}
