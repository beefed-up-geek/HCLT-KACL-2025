I was thinking of ringing you to ask you about it? M: Yes, it was lovely. We had to set off really early because the plane took off at 6:00 AM. But then we were on the beach in the sun by lunchtime. F: Great and what did you do most days? M: Well, we usually slept in. It was very nice not having to get up early and then we stayed up late at night. Going out to discos and nightclubs. During the day we usually lay on the beach or looked round the town. F: And what about the food? M: Well, we didn't usually have any breakfast. By the time we got downstairs at the hotel. They had cleared away all the breakfast things. We tried out different restaurants for lunch and most of them were very good. The fish was particularly nice. And we usually stayed in for dinner at the hotel. F: So what did you like best? M: I liked everything, the beaches, the weather, the food and the nightlife, the people. I'd like to go back again next year. So I'm saving up for it already. People book very early for that area, so I must fix it up right after the new year. If I carry on saving for a few months I'll have enough money.", "id": "dev_335"}
