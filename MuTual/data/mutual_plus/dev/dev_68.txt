That was a good way to keep safe.", "M: So, if you were close to the dive boat, you could get close to the dangerous fish, right?"], "article": "M: I'm on the beach to talk to Mel Flynn, an Australian teenager who spends most of her free time underwater. Hello, Mel. F: Hi. M: How did you become interested in diving? F: I grew up near the beach and I liked watching little fish. My parents say they knew I'd work with fish when I got older. They're both biologists, but more interested in land animals. When I was old enough, I asked if I could go diving. So I could take a closer look at all the amazing things living underwater. M: When did you start to dive? F: I learned to swim when I was 3, but I had to wait 7 years to dive. But even then we couldn't go deeper than 12 meters. M: Did you feel scared? F: Not really. The teacher told us which dangerous fish to avoid and as long as we left them alone, we wouldn't be in danger. And we were never too far from our dive boat.", "id": "dev_68"}
