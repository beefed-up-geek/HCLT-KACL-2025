You spoke so rapidly that I did not catch the meaning of what you said. Could you repeat that?", "F: Great! We will buy a bed for the baby."], "article": "F: Darling, I've been thinking. You know Jane and Robert who just moved in next door have just had a baby girl. I really think we ought to get them some sort of present. M: You're right. Have you got anything in mind? F: Why don't we get the baby a nice little dress? I was in mother care the other day and they had some lovely ones in there. M: A dress? I expect they've received lots of clothes for the baby. What about a toy, something the baby can play with? F: Newborn babies don't play with toys, darling. They just sleep, eat and cry. Maybe we should get Jane and Robert something useful for the baby. M: Yes, useful and boring. F: Boring? Just because something's useful doesn't mean it has to be boring. M: Well, I still think a toy would be better. We could get her one of those things you put on the child's bed that plays music and goes around in circles. F: Oh, yes. You mean a wind bell. Yes, that's a good idea. Why don't we go and see if we can find this afternoon? M: Alright.", "id": "dev_404"}
