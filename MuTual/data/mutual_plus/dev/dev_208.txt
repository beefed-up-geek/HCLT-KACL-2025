F: I thought you might be able to give me some ideas about what to do while I'm in Sydney. That's where you come from, isn't it? M: That's right, and I wish I was there now instead of here in the cold. F: What's the temperature likely to be there? M: About 25 degrees. You will absolutely like the warm weather there. So how long are you staying in Sydney? F: Only a week. I'm going to spend another 3 weeks touring other parts of Australia. M: Then I think you should walk around the rocks. It's the oldest part of the city and always crowded with tourists of all nationalities as well as local people. But cafes and restaurants keep very busy. Whenever I go back to Sydney, I enjoy sitting outdoors with a cup of coffee, watching the people passing by. F: That sounds like a good idea. Well, thanks for the suggestion. I'm looking forward to my holiday.", "id": "dev_208"}
