But this is the year of our 17-year bird calls. F: You mean it's only noisy right now for me and it won't be like this again until 2034? M: Well, it's not all summer long. They just come out when the weather gets cool, usually after a big storm. They'll be quiet after 4 or 5 weeks. F: Where do they go for the next 17 years?
