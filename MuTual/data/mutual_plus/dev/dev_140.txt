M: Well, my college work usually takes at least 2 hours. F: Is at all? Then I think maybe I spend too much time looking for information every day. I start off by researching one topic on a website, and then I follow a link to something else. Suddenly I realize how late it is, and I'm on a completely different subject, and I still haven't finished the work I was supposed to do. M: It's a waste of time, and you know you can't believe everything you read on the Internet. F: Oh yes, that's why I never go into chat rooms. You have no idea who you're talking to and what they might find out about you. M: What I really like are online games, sometimes I stay up really late playing. F: I find them boring, and it's not good for you to sit in front of a screen for too long. M: You're right, so I'm trying to limit my time playing online games, and you can stop visiting websites that aren't going to be useful for your work. F: Ok, and then let's go to the cinema this evening with the time that we've saved. M: Great.", "id": "dev_140"}
