Could you repeat a little louder, please?"], "article": "F: This is the last Department, we have in your price range, and it is by far the nicest of the 3:00. You can see it has a great view over the city, and it is a good price, considering its place. M: Wow, that's a great view over the harbor. F: Isn't it? And it's got everything. Washing machine, dryer, dishwasher. You name it. M: Hum, I wonder how I would get my furniture all the way up to the thirteenth floor, though. F: There is an elevator for that. M: Ok, what about the bills? F: Heating and water are included in the rent. Although electricity, cable TV and internet access are not. Rent is $3000 per month. M: Alright, the first place we looked at included everything, correct? The basement suite? F: Yes, although prices are a little different outside the city, that's why it's $1600 cheaper.", "id": "dev_156"}
