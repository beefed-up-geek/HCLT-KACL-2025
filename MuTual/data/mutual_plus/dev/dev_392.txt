Would you mind speaking more slowly?", "M: See you tomorrow at 8:00pm at the cinema gate and I will drive us to the club.", "M: I'll take bus No.7 to the club as you said. Then we can meet at the bus station."], "article": "F: Are you busy tomorrow night? I'm going over to the workers club for volleyball. If you'd like to come along? M: Isn't that far away? F: Not really. If you take the number 3 bus, you can get there in 10 minutes. And if volleyball doesn't interest you, they've got a huge indoor swimming pool, a weights room and an indoor track. It's a great place to meet people. M: Now that you mention it, it would be nice to get away from the computer center for a change. And I really should get so more exercise. Working up a sweat in a ball game or the weights room would be nice. I've gotten so fat. F: Of course. Look at me, you're not the only one. In high school I had a lot more time to do sport activities. I was never a great athlete, but I had enough time to play tennis with my friends regularly. And during the winter, I'd go skating almost once a week at a place near my home. But after starting college, all that extra time disappeared, because I was always hitting the books. Now what little spare time you have must be used in doing exercises. At least the club is open until 12:00 am. M: I guess it's worth a visit. Did you say you going tomorrow night? F: Yeah. M: OK. I'll come to. How about meeting me in front of the cinema at 8:00? And we'll catch the bus there. F: Sure, see you then.", "id": "dev_392"}
