Why did you choose that subject? M: Well. We'd learned a lot about the environment in our science lessons, so I decided to see what I could do in my own life rather than just act completely helpless. And I knew the rest of my family would be interested. F: Did you find it easy to get information? M: Yeah, I discovered there were lots of people at my age trying to be green. I'd always gone to school by car. Catching a bus would be better, but there's no bus where we live. So I've gone for riding my bike to school now. F: OK. And what about being green once you're actually at school? M: Well, I realized that although all school paper was recycled and most of my friends use both sides of paper. We use huge quantities and I thought we should cut down and then it came to me that we should be sending in most of our work electronically. I'm going to recommend it to our teachers. F: And what about the school cafeteria? M: One school I've read about has meatless Mondays. It's good to use local produce, too. That something our school already does, but we still have machines with bottled milk, water and juices for sale. And I think we shouldn't have them.", "id": "dev_462"}
