F: I sleep in every morning, sometimes until 11 or 12. M: Are you serious? I get up at 5:00 every morning to go to the gym and then I get to work around 7:00. F: Well, I work from home. So I can set my own hours. I usually work until midnight or one in the morning and then I like to sleep in. M: I like to be in bed around 9:00 or 10:00 at night so I can get enough sleep. Our schedules are very different. You're lucky that you get to set your own schedule, but I could never sleep that late. I'm definitely a morning person. F: And I'm definitely a night person. Waking up early is so terrible. M: Maybe we should switch schedules for a week. F: Now way. I would never want your schedule. M: Very funny. What are you doing today? F: Well, it's Saturday so I was thinking of taking a hike. Would you like to come? M: Sure. Can we go to see a movie afterwards? F: I don't really like movies actually. Can we do something else?
