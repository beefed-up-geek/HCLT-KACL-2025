Please could you tell me again?"], "article": "M: Did you catch the mouse yet? I know you wanted to get rid of it before your mom comes to stay with you. F: I didn't. 2 weeks of planning and nothing. My mom always wants the house to be clean. I don't want her to know I had a mouse here. She would be so uncomfortable. M: Well, the traps usually work if you put peanut butter in them. You can take the mouse out to a field and let it go. F: I bought some of those and tried the peanut butter, but it didn't really work. It sure did love that peanut butter though. M: Well, how about a trap that has glue on it? You could still let it go later.", "id": "dev_198"}
