That lovely dog always tells us the truth of life in his simple words. F: I like the Snoopy Series 2. I thought you wouldn't like cartoons. Don't you feel them too childish? M: Not at all. Cartoons are fun not only for kids, but also for adults. F: I quite agree. We adults need simple and interesting things in our stressful lives. M: I like cartoon movies, too. Many of them are great works. F: Me too. What's your favorite one? M: Ice Age, it's fantastic. F: Tell me something about the movie, I've heard about it, but I've never seen it. M: Oh really? It's a rather old movie coming out around 2003. It's so classical that you shouldn't have missed it, it's a story about what happens to a group of animals at the end of the Ice Age. The pictures are beautiful and the whole movie is very imaginative. F: Are there just animals? No humans? M: There are only a few humans, not as hateful as they are in most cartoon movies.
