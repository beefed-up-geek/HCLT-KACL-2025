I've had a terrible morning. M: Oh no, what happened? F: It's my car. I came out of the house this morning and found that the back window had been broken into pieces. M: Oh no, that's awful. What were they after? The car's MP3 player? F: Yeah, I guess that might have been it. Because they did take that. It would have been OK if that had been all they got. But they got away with my handbag, too. I'd somehow stupidly managed to leave it on the back seat. M: Oh, no. Was there much in it? F: No, not really, but there was a spare set of keys in there and my home address. Fortunately, I took my new iPhone with me.", "id": "train_2389"}
