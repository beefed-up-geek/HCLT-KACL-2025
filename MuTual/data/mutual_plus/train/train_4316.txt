I'm planning a trip to Memphis with my family this summer. F: Great. I'd love to host you here. When are you coming? M: We'll leave Boston on June twentieth, stay in St Louis, Missouri for a week, and then fly to your city. We'd probably stay for 5 days with you and come back, for it's a two week vacation. F: Is there anything special you'd like to do here? M: We'd love to explore Beale Street, the official home of the Blues, where we'd listen to live music. We'd also like to visit Graceland, the popular museum in memory of Elvis Presley. But above all, we want to spend some time with you and your family. F: Of course, it's been ages since we met last time. Let's have a dinner party in my garden. M: Lovely. Oh, could you find for us a hotel near where you live?
