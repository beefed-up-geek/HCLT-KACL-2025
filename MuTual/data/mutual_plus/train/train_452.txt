F: No, I only shop at small local stores. That place looks huge. M: You should really go. It has everything you could need to make your Vietnamese food too. They have imported items from several countries. The vegetables are pretty fresh and the meat is of good quality. F: But how are the prices? M: There are great deals, especially for dried foods. I bought a 10-pound-bag of rice for $5, and I found 2 pounds of special noodles for a dollar. There are hundreds of sauces in jars. I even found a Thai sauce there that I couldn't find anywhere else. I think you'll be very happy with what you find at this market. F: Well, I will check it out on Monday. I wonder if they have the pho noodles that I like a lot. M: Probably. You should go on Saturday instead. That's when they have the best deals.", "id": "train_452"}
