Actually, she once did. The same climb in 2007. Catherine, was it easier the second time around? F: In many ways. They were totally different experiences. The first time I went as part of an organized group. We took 4 days to reach the top. This year, I decided to go alone with just one overnight stop, actually you're never really alone. It's all been crowded up there. The first climb, was quite difficult is the weather was very changeable, and we found ourselves climbing in very cold windy conditions. The weather this time was wonderful. Plus. I spent a few days before in chamonix and got myself more used to the height. If it's certainly made it easier, you can also achieve the same thing by climbing some of the smaller mountains first.", "id": "train_4230"}
