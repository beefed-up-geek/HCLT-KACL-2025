F: A man with white hair and a beard, isn't that how you describe yourself in the telex? So it's easy to spot you in any crowd. Let me introduce myself. I am Tan Ling, source manager of Yellow River Import and Export Corporation. How do you do? M: How do you do? F: Well, Mr. Green, do you have any unaccompanied luggage? M: No. I always travel with this bag or with small suitcase only. F: Let's go then. This way to the front door. Let me carry your bag. M: No, I wouldn't dream of letting a lady carry things for me. Surely I'm not so old as that yet. F: Of course not. You look young and energetic in spite of your white hair, Mr. Green. M: Thank you. I'm glad to hear that. F: The car is waiting outside to take us to the hotel. I reserved a suite for you at the Phoenix, one of the biggest in Dublin. M: Do you mean one of the largest suite or one of the biggest hotel?
