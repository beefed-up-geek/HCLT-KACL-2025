Sometimes it can be impossible to get a cab in the rain. M: No worries. Where to? F: I'm going to fifth avenue and east twenty second street, no rush at all though. M: Well, that's good because it looks like we're not going to be able to move more than a few feet per minute. F: Well, that's what happens when it starts to rain during rush hour.
