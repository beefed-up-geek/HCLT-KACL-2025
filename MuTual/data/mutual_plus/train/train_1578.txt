It's a new set of 3 smart devices: a wristband, a scale and a heart-rate monitor. They all record information about you when you exercise, which is then collected in the app UA Record. F: I like that all of the information goes into one app, but it doesn't sound very different from other products that are already out there. M: Check this out, though. You can touch the screen of the wristband to signal that you're starting or ending an activity. Then the scale measures your body fat and weight, while the monitor tracks your heart rate. You wear the heart monitor on a band around your chest. The best part about it is that you can set goals and measure your progress. F: How much does it cost?", "id": "train_1578"}
