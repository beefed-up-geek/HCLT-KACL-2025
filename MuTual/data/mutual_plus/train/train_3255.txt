M: Life in the great outdoors isn't exactly what I expected. F: What did you do everyday? M: First, everyone had to get up at 5:30 AM. Next, we had to make our beds before our camp adviser came to inspect the place. Then we had breakfast around 6:30 AM. After that, we had some free time, so I'd go down to the nearby stream to fish for a couple of hours. But yesterday, the only thing I caught was an old shoe and a tree branch. Then I slipped and fell in the stream and lost my fishing pole. In the afternoon, there were different activities we could choose from like swimming, horseback riding, and hiking.", "id": "train_3255"}
