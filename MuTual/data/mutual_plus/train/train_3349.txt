I'm sure we both have to deal with homesickness, because we're so far away from our own country. F: Yes, it's very difficult. In special seasons like Christmas or during the Holy Week, it is something that we celebrate a lot and I really feel homesick. M: How do you deal with homesickness? F: When I feel homesick, I never stay at home alone. One thing I do is that I always try to go for things in the neighborhood. So what do the locals do? Is there anything interesting? And it's a sort of adventure because you're doing something new, so you're kind of replacing something that you used to do by something new. So, in a way, it's nice dealing with homesickness. M: Yeah. F: What about you? M: Well, that's what I was going to say. You said replacing and I also focus myself on other activities, such as playing golf, swimming and watching TV. But what I like best is to go hiking with the friends I've made and we talk a lot.", "id": "train_3349"}
