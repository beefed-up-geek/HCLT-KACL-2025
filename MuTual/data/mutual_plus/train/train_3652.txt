I was late getting off work and then I missed the bus. The bus I did catch got caught in a traffic jam. It was one thing after another. M: But, why did you get off work so late? The office closes at 6, doesn't it? F: Yes, but there's a rash on at the moment in my boss asked me to work on some urgent letters. M: But didn't you tell him you had an appointment? F: Well. No, I thought I'd finish in about 5 minutes. If it hadn't been for missing the bus and the traffic, I wouldn't have been so late. I'm sorry! M: Well, near here, and that's the main thing. Though you were late for the movie, we can have dinner together. F: Thank you. I won't be late again.", "id": "train_3652"}
