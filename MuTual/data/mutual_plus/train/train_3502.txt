But there are so many books about him now. What makes the one you read so special? M: Well, the one I read is by Walter Isaacson. It's different from the others, because Steve Jobs himself asked Isaacson to write it. F: Uhm, were they friends or something? M: Well, they knew each other well because Isaacson used to work for Time magazine in the 1980s. And he wrote about Apple products. But it was mostly a business relationship I think. F: So, what's the book about? M: Oh, his entire life. There's a lot of personal information about Steve Jobs, because so many people, including his wife, kids and closest coworkers, agreed to be interviewed only for this particular book. F: It sounds interesting. Did you learn anything that really surprised you? M: I always knew he was a tough person, but I was amazed at how sensitive he was. He actually cries a lot in the book.", "id": "train_3502"}
