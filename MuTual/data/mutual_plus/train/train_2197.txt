Go ahead to have a talk with your mother Helen.", "F: Yeah, I think this is something abnormal. You really should talk with her father.", "F: Now you know that you need to be a good dad and spend more time with Helen."], "article": "F: You look very anxious this evening. Is there anything wrong? M: I'm worried about my 15 year old niece Helen. F: What's worrying you. M: I've seen a big change in her. She used to be very outgoing and sociable, but now she is having problems with other children at school. Now, she is totally someone else. F: Really? M: Yes. Now, she is quiet and doesn't want to talk to anyone else. Her teacher said things are going backward in her study. F: Her parents must be very anxious about her. M: No, not really. Both of them are too busy to worry about their daughter. I think I need to talk to them and ask them to spend more time with Helen. F: Take it easy. It is something natural. I was outgoing when I was a little girl, but became very shy in teenage years. So don't be nervous about your niece. M: Maybe you are right, but I will talk with my brother anyway.", "id": "train_2197"}
