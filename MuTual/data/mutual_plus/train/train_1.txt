It's the style that makes it special. It is worth the price.", "F: I am afraid I did not quite catch what you were saying. Please repeat it.", "F: But the color of our suit is very special."], "article": "M: Excuse me. How much is this suit? F: It's on sale today for $750. It's normally $900.

It's the finest in the world, and if you bought a suit made of this material at many department stores, you would pay about $2000. M: Uh-hah. But isn't that the point of coming to a market like this, to get a discount compared to the expensive department stores? Besides I saw a suit just like this one a few stalls down, and they were selling it for $600. I still thought that it was too expensive.", "id": "train_1"}
