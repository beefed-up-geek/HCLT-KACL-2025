F: Hello, I'd like to ask about the package tour from Newcastle to London. M: Sure, what's your question? F: Your website says that the trip starts off every Thursday. Can I join the trip on July thirtieth? M: Sorry, I'm afraid it's full. How many people are going? F: My husband and our two children will go with me. M: 4 people then. There is still enough places on August sixth. Will that do? F: That's fine. Any discount for children under 12? M: Sorry, the price for children is the same, 700 pounds each person. It's already cheaper than other agencies. F: Alright, I'd like to book it. My name is Lisa Garcia and my number is 1-976-344-5829.
