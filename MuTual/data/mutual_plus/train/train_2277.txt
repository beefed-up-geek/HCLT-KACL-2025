I'm worried about my sister, Alice. She's in college and has just declared art as her major. M: Why does that worry you? I've seen her paintings. She's very talented in art. F: I know, but I'm afraid that once she graduates, she won't be able to make ends meet. It is said that most artists only make about 60% of what the average person makes a year. What's more, it's harder for art majors to find a full time job. But she doesn't seem too concerned. M: But you're forgetting that there's even more for them to choose. Alice loves art and that's what's important. Even if she can't make much money, she'll be happy and emotionally satisfied. F: But she'll have bills to pay. It's going to be hard for her to lead a lifestyle on what an artist makes. M: Don't be worried. And I know what you mean. Let's have a talk with Alice and listen to her.", "id": "train_2277"}
