M: When I got my first job back in nineteen eighty two and started traveling, I had no other choice but to eat out. I found that I felt different due to what I was eating, so I try to find places that served food that made me feel good. The secret was the quality of the food and how well the food was prepared. I made an effort to find good restaurants as well as nice dishes. F: How did you manage to make a list of 218 favorite restaurants? M: I have lived in many cities. And when I moved back to Sweden from the United States, people asked me where to go to eat when they went to cities I knew. I got a lot of ideas. Then I wrote about restaurants for the Swedish Clubs Magazine. And someone suggested I gather the information about the restaurants together. Since I had all the facts about the restaurants, I had been too. I started to do that. F: How do you find restaurants? M: The best way is to ask the people there. I may talk to people at a street market or take a walk and look for a place myself. I never ask a hotel clerk or a taxi driver.
