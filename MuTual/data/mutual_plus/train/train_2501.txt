F: Yes, I have a master's degree in drama and theater. At the moment, I'm hoping to get on to a PhD program. M: What excites you about drama? F: Well, I find it's a communicative way to study people and you learn how to read people in drama. So usually I can understand what people are saying even though they might be lying.

They really respond well. At the moment, I'm hoping to get on to a PhD course. I'd like to concentrate on Asian drama and try to bring Asian theater to the world's attention.
