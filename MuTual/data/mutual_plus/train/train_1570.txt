M: I'm working on my college application. I just started writing my personal statement, but I'm having a hard time. F: What does it have to be about? M: It's basically just an essay about why I want to go to college and what I hope to do there. It's difficult to write, because I don't know what to major in yet. I know I want to go to college. I just don't have an idea of why I want to go. F: Why not just tell the truth in your essay? M: You mean I should write about the fact that I don't know what to do with my life? F: Yeah. I mean, I doubt if anyone really knows what career they want to have when they first go to college. You have years to figure that out.", "id": "train_1570"}
