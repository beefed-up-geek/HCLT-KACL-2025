M: Yes, his company has decided to send him to London to take charge of their branch office. He'll fly there next Friday. F: You have such a good son, always doing the right thing at the right time.

I'm sure Nancy will get over it. Oh, it's very late. I have to go now and pick up my granddaughter from her kindergarten. Thank you so much for your invitation. I really enjoyed our talk.
