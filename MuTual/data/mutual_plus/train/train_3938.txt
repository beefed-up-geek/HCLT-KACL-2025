No wonder you don't like LA at all."], "article": "M: Hi, Jane. Welcome back. How was the west coast? F: Terrific. I had a wonderful time. It was really nice to get away from the city for a while. M: What did you think of Los Angeles? F: It was alright. I liked it better than I thought I would. It's very clean and spacious and it's got a lot of trees. The problem is transportation.
