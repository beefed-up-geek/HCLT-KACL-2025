M: Um, let me think, it's difficult to choose one thing in particular, I grew up around sport. My best friend Mike likes sports. My mom was a really good athlete actually. F: Oh yes. M: We used to go and see her running marathons, which made a big impression on me as a child. I suppose it's in my blood. F: Right, fantastic. And how do you think teachers can encourage their students to enjoy sports? M: Em, that's an interesting question. On one hand, I think many students enjoy the competitive activities. They want to be the best and it's motivating for them. On the other hand, we need to encourage the ones were not as confident, so we need to reward them for participating in trying their best. It's not all about winning. F: OK, thank you very much Jack, you make some good points. M: Thank you.", "id": "train_257"}
