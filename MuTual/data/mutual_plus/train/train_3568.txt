M: Well, thanks for making me feel better. F: I can hardly recognize you. Tell me what happened. M: I just got back from Africa, where I had a terrible accident during a motorcycle race. I broke both my legs when my motor failed and was hit by another motorcycle. I was laid up in a hospital over there for 3 weeks. F: 3 weeks. That's a long time! What did you do while you were in the hospital? M: Well, if you can believe it, I read all about motorcycle racing. I love racing, even when it pains me. F: Haha, but I'm afraid you don't make it look very funny. You are lucky to be alive. M: That's for sure. I am lucky to be alive. F: How soon will you recover? Did the doctor tell you? M: They say I still need to stay in bed for 2 weeks or so. F: You'll probably put on some pounds in that much time. By the way, is there anything I can do for you? M: No, thank you. Thank you for the beautiful flowers. It's very kind of you to come and see me.", "id": "train_3568"}
