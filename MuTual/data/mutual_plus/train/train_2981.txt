M: Oh, yes? F: They're really nice. There is a lot of space and each house has got 3 bedrooms and a separate shower room. M: Hmm... F: And there is a garden at the back. John, will you put down your book? Aren't you interested? M: Not especially. F: But why I thought you wanted to move? M: You are the one who wants to move. F: But you said the last time your brother stayed. It is impossible to live without an extra bedroom. M: I didn't say that. I like this flat. I can walk to work. F: You could still walk to work if we move. M: It is farther away and it is being far more noisy near the Sports Center. F: But it is not exactly quiet living on this main road.
