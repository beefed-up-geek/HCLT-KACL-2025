It's too expensive!"], "article": "M: Excuse me. How much is this suit? F: It's on sale today for $750. It's normally $900. M: Wow, that is pretty expensive! I was thinking that it might be 4 or 500. F: This material is imported from Italy. It's the finest in the world, and if you bought a suit made of this material at many department stores, you would pay about $2000. M: Uh-hah. But isn't that the point of coming to a market like this, to get a discount compared to the expensive department stores? Besides I saw a suit just like this one a few stalls down, and they were selling it for $600. I still thought that it was too expensive. F: It's possible that the suit you saw was the same color is this one but made of a different material. Unfortunately, our prices are final, and we think there are the lowest anywhere in the city.", "id": "train_2"}
