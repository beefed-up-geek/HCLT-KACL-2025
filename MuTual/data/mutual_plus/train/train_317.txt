Could you repeat a little louder, please?", "F: Yes, we should focus on more the character of person, for example, you should tell me more when you mentioned Mike's mother just now.", "F: Well, a person's career is really important, so we should talk more about the person you mentioned a few minutes ago, that's Alice, right?"], "article": "M: I'm really bored at the moment. F: Let's play a game. I'll describe someone and you try to guess who it is. OK, this man is tall and thin, he has blue eyes and curly brown hair. M: Does he have a mustache or a beard? F: Good question, yes, he has a mustache, but no beard. M: Sounds like Mike, doesn't it? F: Yes, you're right. Now, you describe someone we both know. M: OK, she's not very tall, but she is a little heavy, she has blonde hair. F: I don't think I know anyone like that. M: And she wears fashionable shoes, in fact, she wears fashionable clothes too. F: This doesn't sound like anyone I know. I give up, tell me who she is. M: She's your mother. F: Huh, that's actually a pretty good description, but it's embarrassing that I couldn't figure that out, my own mother. Do you think appearance is the most important thing about a person? M: No, but it's more important than a person's character in the game we're playing.", "id": "train_317"}
