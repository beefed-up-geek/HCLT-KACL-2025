F: Yes, I was wondering how much it would cost to translate a document from English into Arabic? M: Well, it depends on the kind of document how long it is and when you need it returned. We don't do any translations of textbooks. F: It's a cookbook about 20,000 words long. It is not urgent so you can set your own schedule. M: Well, ma'am, Arabic is one of the most difficult languages in the world. And there aren't very many translators compared to say Spanish. In other words, the charge for Arabic translation will be higher than for most other languages. F: I understand, could you give me an estimate? M: For this project, we would charge between 5 and 10 cents per word. F: OK, thanks for your time, I think I will keep looking.", "id": "train_1193"}
