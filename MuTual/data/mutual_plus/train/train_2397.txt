So, you don't choose the first place just because it's too cold there?", "F: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t understand. Could you repeat a little louder, please?"], "article": "F: OK, I think we have 2 choices of where we can spend our vacation. The first place is a little house. It's located on a fruit farm. But it says there is no air conditioner. M: That's OK. It's on the rainy side of the island. It's cooler there. F: You're probably right. But there is no washing machine or dryer, not even a TV. M: Oh no, no TV? That's terrible. What's our second choice? F: It's on the opposite side of the island, a very nice place with a big swimming pool. It's only 3 blocks from the ocean and the pool area also has a beautiful garden. M: Wow, it does have everything, washing machine, dryer, TV, refrigerator. All we need is our toothbrushes. Let's go with the second choice. I can't wait to go.", "id": "train_2397"}
