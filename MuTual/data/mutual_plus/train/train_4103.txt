I made some sandwiches earlier and left them on the table when I went to answer the phone. But someone must have taken them, because they're gone. M: Oh, it must have been dad. I'm sure he was in the kitchen earlier. F: No, he went off to his tennis match before I finished making them, so he couldn't have done it. Anyway, he couldn't carry a plate of sandwiches as well as his tennis stuff, so I'm sure it wasn't him. M: Well, it wasn't me.
