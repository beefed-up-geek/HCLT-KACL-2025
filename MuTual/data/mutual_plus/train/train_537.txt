The only problem is that it's aimed at teenagers only. It holds no interest for any other age group. F: I like the great musical performances in Fitzgerald's film. He's also a gifted violinist and guitarist, isn't he? M: Well, I never see him play the violin or the guitar. As far as I know, the piano is the only instrument he likes. F: I've heard that quite a few important people dislike him. Do you know anything about this? M: Well, Fitzgerald expressed his opinions directly. And that sometimes makes those important people annoyed. You see, he has his own ideas about life. And he doesn't simply take on other peoples because they're famous. Indeed, it is this very aspect of his personality that I find most attractive. I think the only person he admires and respects is Freddie Taylor. F: But they have different personalities. Freddy has a warm heart and he is easy to get along with.", "id": "train_537"}
