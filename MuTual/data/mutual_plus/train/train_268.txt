Congratulations on your book Life And Everything In Between Steven hit such a success. M: Thank you. F: This is your first attempt at poetry. Did you ever try it before? Did you take any classes in poetry? M: Well, my only real experience was writing business plans. I've always had a good grasp of the English language, my mom encouraged me to read when I was very little. F: What's the hardest thing about creating your work? M: Finding the perfect words to fit what I wanted to say, there's always a word or 2 that I might still rewrite if given the chance. F: Will there be more collections of poetry? M: There will be more of something I suppose, but maybe not poetry. I really don't see myself as a poet. Rather, I see what I wrote as a kind of writing that might inspire people in some way.", "id": "train_268"}
