My wife and I really need someone to look after the children. After we had our first baby 6 years ago, my wife left her job as a lawyer to care for him. Then we had a little girl. That was 2 years ago. But my wife has decided to start teaching at a university, so we'd like to hire someone to watch them during the day. F: Well, I have a lot of experience taking care of children. I started baby-sitting my own little brothers and sisters when I was in middle school. I also looked after other people's children to make money when I was in high school, and last year I took the Red Cross safety course so I know basic first aid.", "id": "train_1814"}
