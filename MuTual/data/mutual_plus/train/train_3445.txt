We will meet around 12:30. Oh, I am so excited that we will meet to do some sports."], "article": "F: Hello, Jim. Looking forward to seeing you. It's not a bad journey, really. M: But what do I do when there? How can I get to your place? F: Don't worry. When you get to Waterloo, take the underground to Regents Park. I'll meet you there at the gate, which will be obvious when you get there. You can't miss it. By the way, when are you leaving? M: I am ready now. I'll get the... the 1138, a southern train, I think it is. That's non-stop to Waterloo and do I get the underground there? F: That's it. You will go straight there on the underground. You want the Bakerloo line to Regents Park. It's only about 4 stops. Make sure you get a northern underground though. You want northern Bakerloo, OK? M: OK, I'll be there soon. F: Oh, by the way, I'll be with Tom. We're going to play badminton later at the college badminton club. Hey, would you like to join the club? Its gym is modern and quite bright and it has some great special services for members. Oh, if you want to catch your train, you'd better go now. It must be nearly 11:30 already. M: Wow, you're right and it's just after half past. I didn't realize it was so late. I have less than 10 minutes. I better take my bag right now and run. See you around 12:30. Bye.", "id": "train_3445"}
