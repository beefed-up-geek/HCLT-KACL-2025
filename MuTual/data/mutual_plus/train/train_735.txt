Why don't we make our vacation longer and bike across Europe? We could still end our trip in Austria or we could go all the way to Greece. F: That sounds a lot harder than taking a train or a car. M: It isn't so bad really, lots of people do it. We're both pretty strong physically and have good bikes. We could spend the whole summer on our trip instead of visiting your parents for half of it. We could promise to visit them for New Years. F: It would be a good way to see the countryside and I love being in nature, would there be enough places to spend the night along the way? M: Some friends of mine went on a biking trip during university. They said there are many little roadside inns. Sometimes they even stayed with farmers or camped in fields. F: I'm all for it. Will we still start out in France, like we had planned at first? M: I think if we bike, we should begin our trip in Spain. I want to see some of the beautiful architecture there.", "id": "train_735"}
