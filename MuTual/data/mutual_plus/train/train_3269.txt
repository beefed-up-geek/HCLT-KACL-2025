You'd like to rent the place? F: Yes, I'd like to have a look at this house. M: That's quite good. Let me show you around the place. How do you like the location? F: The place is very convenient.

F: The living room is big and the kitchen is OK. M: And this is a very safe building, too. F: That's good. The advertisement says the rent is $350 a month, right?
