I know you never check the rooms after the guests move out, but that's OK.", "F: You are very patient with complaints from guests, but you can pay more attention to the preparation jobs.", "F: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t catch that. Would you mind speaking more slowly?", "F: Why do I have to remind you everything? You are too careless. Everything is not working except for the toilet."], "article": "M: Can I help you, madam? F: Yes. Did you have this room checked before we moved in? The toilet doesn't seem to have enough power and the water doesn't flow away in the shower. What do you have to say to that? M: I'm extremely sorry to hear that. I'll attend to it right away. We usually check every room before new guests move in. We've been busy with a large conference. F: That's not what you should do after all. One doesn't expect this sort of thing here. M: No, madam. I do apologize. It's most unusual. We do try to check the room as thoroughly as possible.
