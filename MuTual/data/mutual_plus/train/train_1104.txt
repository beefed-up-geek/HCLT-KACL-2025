M: That's kind of a strange question for this setting. Don't you think so? F: Well, the teacher hasn't come in yet, class hasn't begun and I was just wondering about it. So what do you think about friends? M: I've never regarded them as particularly important. Perhaps that's because I come from a big family, two brothers and three sisters, and lots of cousins. That's what's really important to me. What about you? F: My situation, you know, is different. So I have different ideas. To me, friendship is being most important thing in life.
