But if  I bring the bike back after 7:00 pm, I cannot get the 50 dollars back.", "M: I am afraid I did not quite catch what you were saying. Please repeat it."], "article": "M: I'd like to rent a bike for a day. How much does it cost? F: It's $20 a day. A day is from 9 o'clock in the morning until 7 o'clock in the evening. M: So if I brought the bike back at 7:30, would I have to pay for an extra day? F: Yes, and there's a deposit to pay as well. It's $50. Then when you bring the bike back, we'll give you back the $50. But if you didn't bring the bike back before 7:00 PM, we'd keep the money of course. M: Well. You don't need to worry. I'll surely bring the bike back at 5 o'clock. Do you have helmets, by the way? F: Of course. It's free to rent a helmet. Let's go and choose a bike and helmet for you.", "id": "train_1595"}
