You don't want a window seat, right?", "M: No problem. 7A is a good seat because it is next to the window.", "M: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t catch that. Would you mind speaking more slowly?", "M: You are welcome. 7A is a perfect seat for you since you do not like a window seat."], "article": "F: Excuse me? I think you are in my seat. Look, it says 9B on my boarding card. M: Sorry, but could we exchange seats? This is my old friend. We haven't seen each other for a long time. I really want to sit next to him. F: In that case you can sit here, but where is your seat? M: It's 7A. It's a window seat. F: Oh, that's great. I asked for a window seat. But there were not any left. I really didn't expect I'd get one this way. Thank you.", "id": "train_3422"}
