{"answers": "B", "options": ["M: Thank you, Professor Hudson. The two suggestions given bu you are very useful.", "M: Thank you for your three suggestions. I hope I can take better notes by using them.", "M: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t catch that. Would you mind speaking more slowly?", "M: Could you please take a look at my notes first though your four suggestions are very good?"], "article": "M: Can I talk to you for a minute, Professor Smith? F: Sure, David. What can I do for you? M: I didn't get to copy down all the terms you mentioned in today's lecture and I know they were important. F: Do you remember what parts of the lecture you had trouble with? M: Not really. F: Can I take a look at your note? M: Sure. F: Interesting. M: What? F: David, just by looking through your notes from today and from last week's classes, I can tell that you've been missing a lot of important information from my lectures. Your notes are rather incomplete. M: What's wrong? I thought I took good notes. F: Not exactly. I think your note taking skills need some improvement. M: No. F: What I suggest is that you copy down the key points that I put on the board at the start of each class. That way you can follow along and keep up with the main ideas of the lecture. M: OK. F: Second, use the key points to help you fill in the details that develop each main point. Don't worry about writing down everything I say word for word. It looks like you are trying to do that. Focus on understanding the organization of the lecture. That will help you find the most important information you should write down. M: All right. Thanks, Professor Smith. F: Oh, and one more thing, you might find it useful to shorten words and use special marks. That can save you a lot of time.", "id": "train_2246"}
