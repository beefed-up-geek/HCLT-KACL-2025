As a neighbor, I know you never raised a dog, so you won't understand it.", "M: Just a minute! I do not quite follow what you are saying, would you mind repeating that?", "M: It's fine, Lily. You may leave the office now and pick up your son Buster from his school."], "article": "M: Well, any luck? Did you see Buster anywhere? F: No, I couldn't find him either. I drove all around the neighborhood. I circled our block 3 times, hoping he'll show up. No such luck. I'm sorry, Ben. M: It's not your fault. I shouldn't have left the door open. I hope we'll find him. He is such a huge part of our family. He walks with Lily to school every morning. F: I'm sure we'll find him. Ben, I remember when I lost my dog, Spot. We looked for 10 hours and finally we just gave up. Not long after we got home, Spot showed up at our front door. They know how to get home, Ben. They always do. M: I hope you're right, Lucy. Maybe he'll show up before it gets dark. I just hope he's OK. F: He will be, Ben. He has always been loyal to you and your family. He's probably just off exploring.", "id": "train_3453"}
