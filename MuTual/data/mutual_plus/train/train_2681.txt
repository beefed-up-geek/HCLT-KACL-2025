Why not join the club I am in? M: Is it far from our neighborhood? F: No, it's just 10 minutes away from here by bike. M: What do you do there? F: Well, I often start out running for about half an hour and then I get in the swimming pool for an hour. M: I really like swimming. It's a good way to lose weight, isn't it? F: Oh, it certainly is.
