It's not that he has an accent like some of the other speakers from another country. It's just that he is speaking too softly. Do you think it would be rude to ask him to turn his microphone up a little bit? M: I don't think he's wearing one either that or he's turned it off. F: That's crazy. There must be 400 people here. M: This part of the conference has turned into such a waste of time. Maybe we should leave and try to find another lecture. F: I can't do that. I come here specifically to hear this guy's speech. I think I'll just go up to him at the end of the speech and try to ask him some questions. M: Good idea. Would you mind if I followed you up there?
