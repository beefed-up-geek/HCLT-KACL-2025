F: Hi, I would like to rent a car. M: Sure, did you make a reservation? F: No, I decided to rent one when I got off the plane just now. Is that OK? M: Of course. I was just checking. So how many days do you need the car for? F: Can I just do 4 days for now and make the rent longer through a phone call later? M: In that case, I suggest you go for 7 days, which will give you a 20% discount. And if you choose to return the car after 5 days, you can get the rest of your money back. F: OK, I will do that.
