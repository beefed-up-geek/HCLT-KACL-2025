M: Can I give you a hand with the dishes? F: I'll do them myself later. Would you like some coffee? M: Thanks a lot. I'd love some. Oh, Ann, I didn't realize you were such a good cook.

Well, if you want to, you could take several classes at college and learn how to do it, too. M: Forget it. I was not born for that. Oh, I just remembered, I wonder if I could possibly use your phone.
