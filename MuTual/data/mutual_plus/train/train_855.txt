When can you send your purchase order? F: We will send it as soon as possible. We hope you can hurry on the order. M: No problem. But I'll have to check another purchase order, which is to be finished this Friday. Now I'm in Shanghai on business. Anyway, I'll let you know when I come back, and then we can sign a contract. F: Thanks. M: Well, I'm afraid we can't send the products until after the Christmas Holidays. We will begin our holiday in New York next Tuesday and our company will be closed for 2 weeks. F: That's alright. We'll try to have a meeting for the details of the order and send it to you this Thursday. I hope you tell your market manager about it.", "id": "train_855"}
