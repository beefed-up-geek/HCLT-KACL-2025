But I love that I don't need any waiter."], "article": "M: Today I'm talking to Marta Dancedand who runs her own mobile restaurant. Marta, how did you get into the restaurant business? F: Well, I learned to cook at college. I always wanted to open my own restaurant, but had no money so I got a job as a chef. I had all sorts of ideas for new dishes, which the staff thought would sell but the boss wasn't interested. That's when a friend told me about the mobile restaurant idea. It sounded great. M: Tell us about it. F: Well, it works like this. You decide on a menu. Obviously you have to be able to cook. Then you advertise it so people can book a meal. The most amazing thing is all the advertising is done through websites. People set up tables in their sitting room or in a city car park, an empty factory, anywhere in fact and because you know how many people you're cooking for, food doesn't get wasted. M: So why is it good for you? F: Well, various reasons, like I could buy all the things without risk because customers pay in advance. The greatest advantage, though, is by having 10 customers at most. I don't need to hire a waiter. M: Do you ever run into problems?", "id": "train_2635"}
