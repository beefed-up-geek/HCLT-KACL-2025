You said he can write as well as them."], "article": "F: They told me Steven is a very special boy, and he seldom plays with the children. What do you think of him? M: Oh, yes. He is a very special boy in many ways. He doesn't have the normal abilities for the boys of his age. It's very difficult for him to read and write in my class. For example, many 8 year-old boys can do much more than he can. But of course, he has a special gift. F: In drawing? M: Yes. He's always been good at it. Steven can look at any building for about 5 minutes and then draw it perfectly. F: Tell us something about some of the drawings he's done. M: Well, his drawings are most about famous buildings, like the Gulf Palace in Venice and Kremlin in Moscow. They're wonderfully drawn. Famous artists looked at his drawings and said that Steven's an excellent painter. F: And he just looks at these buildings for a few minutes and draws them? M: That's right. It's very strange, isn't it? He has such a special gift in one thing, but finds other things difficult.", "id": "train_3273"}
