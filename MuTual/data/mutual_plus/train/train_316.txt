I'll describe someone and you try to guess who it is. OK, this man is tall and thin, he has blue eyes and curly brown hair. M: Does he have a mustache or a beard? F: Good question, yes, he has a mustache, but no beard. M: Sounds like Mike, doesn't it? F: Yes, you're right. Now, you describe someone we both know.

F: This doesn't sound like anyone I know. I give up, tell me who she is. M: She's your mother.
