I am looking for a pair of trousers for my son. Could I see that pair hanging in the window? F: Sure sir. Is this the pair you meant? M: Yes, that's it. What are these trousers made of? My son's skin is quite sensitive, so I have to be careful about the material of the clothes he wears. F: These are made of cotton, sir. These are made by a famous children's brand called Wonder World. It's a very popular brand because of the good quality material. M: Oh, that's good. What other colors do these trousers come in? If you have blue, that would be great. Blue is my son's favorite color. I'd rather not have black or gray. F: Uh, these come in blue as well. Here you are, a blue pair. M: Thank you. And one last thing, how much do the trousers cost? F: Well, they were originally 150 yuan each, but they are now on sale 20% off.", "id": "train_3136"}
