M: Now this is a question that everyone would like to ask you. How did you get interested in boxing? F: I saw a little television program about women boxing about 6 years ago. And at that moment, I said to myself, I'm going to do that. And it just changed my life. But my parents disagreed at first. M: And were you interested in sport at school? F: No, nothing. I wasn't ever fit or anything. I just don't look after myself at all. M: What do you think is the most important for a top boxer? F: Believe it or not, anyone can fight. But to make it to the top, you have to know your skills. And you have to have a quick brain and the fitness. The fitness side of it is the most important. M: And just lastly, when is your next big fight? F: The next one is going to be the end of February, and I will have another 2 at the beginning of April, and at the end of May. M: Well, that's great. We're looking forward to seeing your performance. Thank you very much Jane.", "id": "train_526"}
