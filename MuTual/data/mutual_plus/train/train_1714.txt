M: I don't know. I was hoping you could help me think of something. F: Well, you're such a good artist. You could talk about watercolor while you're doing one in front of the class. M: Maybe, but what if I make a mistake in front of everyone? F: Come on, you're really talented. Besides you wouldn't have to do much preparation before hand. M: True. F: Or how about this? You could bring in a photo, a pencil drawing and watercolor of the same subject. Something simple so it wouldn't take so much time to do like a flower.
