Nice to see you again. I heard you went into hospital for a few days. I hope everything is OK. M: Yes, fine. I was really nervous just before I had the operation, but strangely enough, the operation was over when I woke up. F: It must have really hurt afterward. M: Well, the nurse gave me plenty of pain killers, but it did feel uncomfortable. I wasn't permitted to eat anything for 48 hours. That was the worst thing. F: I bet you are ready for a nice big steak when you got out of hospital. M: I certainly was. However, the doctor gave me a list of food I couldn't eat for another 72 hours. And steak was on the list. F: Did they take good care of you in the hospital? M: Oh, yes. The nurses were very kind. Though they were strict about what I could drink, in the end, I just drank water and nothing else. How I wish to drink some beer now!", "id": "train_3597"}
