So, my first question is, are you happy with your life? M: Am I happy? You may know you are the first person to have asked me this question directly. The others dared not because they were afraid I might say yes. They wanted me to say no so that they could make up stories about me. F: What kind of stories? M: Brian Sharpe, author of over 100 historical novels, lives in a lonely house 30 miles away from Sydney. But is he happy? (?). F: Is that why you have refused many interviews? M: I'm tired of being told that I must be unhappy because I'm rich and successful. I'm not unhappy. F: Understood. And I'm wondering if you follow a similar pattern of writing. M: I know what you mean. Do I write similar stories? I say no. F: So, how do you create your heroes? M: My heroes live? They think for themselves.
