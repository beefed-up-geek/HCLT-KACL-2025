On last week's program, we interviewed the man behind the idea of the international camps. So I thought that this week, you'd be interested to hear more about one of the camps which will be held later this year. Over to you, Michael. M: Thank you. Yes, to apply for the camp, you don't have to be a student. You don't even have to be employed. But you must be able to speak one foreign language. F: OK. What about the camping? M: Well, the camp organizers supply tents which sleep up to 4 people, but you are unlikely to know the people who you'll be sharing a tent with. Because you'll be sharing with people who may not even speak your language. F: Sounds interesting. Who does the cooking in the camp? M: Everybody is expected to help with the running of the camp. That means helping to prepare food, keeping the campsite clean and so on. The camp organizers are looking for people who can get along with others whatever happens.", "id": "train_2687"}
