I had no idea. It would take so much time. It sure makes it difficult to prepare for final exams. How about you? F: I was lucky. There seems to be a shortage of high school teachers now. I applied to 3 schools and each one offered me a position. M: That's great. Which one did you like? F: I haven't decided yet. Of course, it would be easiest for me to stay here in New York or go back home to Boston but I may go to California. M: That would be a big move. F: So tell me about your plans. M: Well, I applied to 6 newspapers. Last week I had an interview with New York Times. F: How did it go? M: Not so well. I think they're looking for people with some experience. F: Have you had any other interviews? M: No, not yet. It seems that everyone wants to be a writer these days. There just aren't that many jobs out there. F: That's too bad. M: Yes, I had hoped to have a job lined up by graduation. That doesn't seem likely now. F: What will you do if you can't find a job? M: In that case, I'll begin working on a master's degree in the fall.", "id": "train_1850"}
