Every time I walk by our new school, I get a little anxious. M: Why? Everything is going to be so much better. F: Really? I heard it is a lot of extra work. M: Relax. We'll get used to it. Apparently, there was a huge computer room we can study in. Also they have just finished building a new running track and put in artificial grass. F: Cool. We'll have lots of fun on the playground. M: You think that's cool? There are 2 gyms and a indoor swimming pool. Anyway, we have to choose 2 arts courses this year. Any thoughts?
