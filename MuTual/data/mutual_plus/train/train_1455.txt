{"answers": "A", "options": ["F: Of course it is important for a restaurant to have high quality food to serve.", "F: Oh, really? I might like the pink table you mentioned in the restaurant.", "F: Yeah, the great food attracts lots of office workers and the place is big.", "F: I am sorry. You spoke so rapidly that I did not catch the meaning of what you said. Could you repeat that?"], "article": "M: Lily, where do you like to eat? F: Well, my favorite restaurant is the knife and talk. It's very near the city center. At lunch, it's full of office workers, but I like to go before that, in the middle of the morning. I go there and order big breakfast and take one of their newspapers and just relax for an hour or so. Their pancakes are delicious. They don't have a TV in there, which I love most. They just have some jazz music, very quiet. Nothing too loud. What's your favorite restaurant? M: Well, it's just a very simple restaurant. There are only about 6 tables in there, a couple of waitresses wear ugly pink uniforms. But the food is great, very tasty and cheap too, which is important of course. There are some truck drivers sitting at the counter drinking coffee. And eating sausages every morning. I always have pancakes in the morning, and their fish pie for lunch. That restaurant has been open for many years. They say the actor James Dean eats there, sometimes, but I don't think that's true.", "id": "train_1455"}
