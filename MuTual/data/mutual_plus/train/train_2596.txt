M: Thank you. I wonder why it Chinese dinner always starts with cold dishes instead of hot courses. Could you explain that to me? F: Certainly, sir. It's a custom in our country to serve cold dishes first as they have been prepared before hand. M: Oh, I see. The chefs in your country are just in the habit of preparing cold dishes first. F: I'm afraid that's not exactly right, sir. Chinese people usually regard the dinner party as an occasion for a friendly chat. M: Yes, I quite agree. But what does that have to do with serving cold dishes first? F: Well, people usually talk more and eat less at the beginning of the dinner. Therefore, if hot courses were served they would get cold very quickly. M: I see, but the problem is that I'm already full when it comes to the wonderful hot courses. And I often miss the chances to enjoy many Chinese dishes.", "id": "train_2596"}
