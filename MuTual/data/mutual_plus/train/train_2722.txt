F: I had everything timed perfectly. I sat in the coffee shop, waiting for Bus 55. It is supposed to leave at 4:45 sharp. I take it everyday at that time because it arrives at the Waterson Station just in time to catch Bus 15. M: And you lost track of time, didn't you? F: No, Ken, not this time. I was at the bus stop on time and I was picking up my bag and getting to my feet at 4:35. I was two feet from the bus when it suddenly left. M: 10 minutes early?
