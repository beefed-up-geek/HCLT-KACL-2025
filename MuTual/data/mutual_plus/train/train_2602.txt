It won't take long. M: OK. I'd like to help. F: Thanks. How often do you take a bus, every day, less than once a week or somewhere in between? M: I go to school by bus so it's usually twice daily, line 4. F: I see. Could you rate it service if 1 is poor, 2 is fair and 3 is good? Which number would you choose? M: I would say 2. The drivers are nice, the buses are clean and the seats are comfortable. But it's sometimes unreliable. There should be a bus every 10 minutes, but yesterday morning, I waited almost 20 minutes before the bus came and was almost late for school. F: Oh, that's too bad. Do you have some suggestions for the bus company? M: Try to have the buses arrive on time of course, and um, there can be a map on the bus. You know, some passengers cannot use the guidebook very well.", "id": "train_2602"}
