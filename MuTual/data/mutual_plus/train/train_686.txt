F: Hmm, I have an idea that you'll like. This week, you can do a special project for class. M: Oh, what's that? F: I want you to watch some YouTube videos of people speaking in different English accents. I'll send you the links for the ones you should watch, they're very funny. One person does about 30 different accents in 10 minutes. M: Wow, that's great, but, won't it be harder for me to learn English if I'm listening to so many different ways of speaking the language?", "id": "train_686"}
