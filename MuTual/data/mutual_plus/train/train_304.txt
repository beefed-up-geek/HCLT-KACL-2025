You have a great voice and you sing at her local community center every Sunday, don't you? M: Thanks, well. Yes, I do sing at the community center, but that is with a whole bunch of other people. I get really nervous singing in front of many people just by myself. F: You could form a group with someone, that way you may feel more relaxed. M: That sounds like a good idea.
