I'm Paul Daddy Lee. And there is fun time. I'm very happy to welcome actress Gemma Louis today. F: Thank you. M: Actually, shouldn't I call you a film star rather than an actress? After all, you've been world famous since making the film Starshine 2 years ago, haven't you? F: Well. Yes, I suppose. I enjoyed making that film, but I really want to be a stage actress. M: It was quite a surprise to get the lead in Starshine, wasn't it? F: Yes. I got the part in spite of having no film experience. M: How was that? F: I was at a theater school. The director chose me to play the part after visiting several schools. I had a long talk with my parents before I accepted it. In the end, I went for it. M: But you didn't make anymore films after finishing Starshine. Why is that? You must have had plenty of offers. F: Yes, I did. But working far from home, I sometimes felt very lonely. So I came back to England. M: So no more films? F: Oh, I don't know. I'd be happy to do another film, but I'm booked up for the next few months. M: Now, what about the play you're appearing in at the moment? F: It's great. It's actually a comedy called Dark Days.", "id": "train_2038"}
