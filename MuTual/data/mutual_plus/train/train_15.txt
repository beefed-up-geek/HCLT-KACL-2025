F: The seasons? M: Yeah, you know how cold it is in winter? What is it like when the days are so short? F: So what is it like? M: Well, it is cold, very cold in winter. Sometimes it is as cold as 26 degrees below centigrade. And of course, when you go out, you'll wrap up warm. But in the houses, is always very warm, much warmer than at home. Swedish people always complain that when they visit England, the houses are cold, even in a good winter. F: And what about the darkness? M: Well, yeah, around Christmas time there's only one hour of daylight, so you really look forward to the spring. It is sometimes a bit depressing, but you see the summers are amazing.
