You look exhausted. M: Hi, Mary. Yeah. I'm totally beat. I can barely keep my eyes open. F: Was it a rough trip? M: Well, it was actually pretty productive. But all the flying really got to me. F: Oh, jet lag. M: Yep. I flew from Beijing to Boston for a meeting and then got on a plane to go to the trade fair in Frankfurt. Then back to Beijing before catching a train back here to Shanghai. F: Wow, that's a lot of traveling. No wonder you're exhausted. M: The worst thing was adjusting to the time zones. It's so hard to get used to the difference. F: Yeah, it's hard.
