Are we setting up camp here or are we going to follow the trail down to the river? M: Let's rest here for a bit. I told the others to meet us here, so we could take advantage of the view. But we should go down to the river to put up the tents. F: How did you find out about this place? It seems pretty far away from towns. M: My dad used to live near here. When I was young, my uncle took my brother and me to his cabin and we used to fish there. F: Why don't we just sleep there then? M: It's abandoned, so there's nothing there. By the way, did you bring the water up from the car? F: No, I thought you brought it. Now, we have to go back down to the car. M: Calm down.
