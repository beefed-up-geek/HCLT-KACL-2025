M: Yes, my wife and I want to take a holiday this winter, to someplace warmer. F: I understand. How long do you want to take? M: Only a week between Christmas and New Year. That's the problem, you see. F: There is no problem. We can find you a flight to Australia leaving at Christmas and coming back on New Year's Eve. And it will only cost $500 per person. M: Actually, we'd like to go somewhere nearer. $1000 is a lot to spend for such a short time. How about some places nearer with few tourists? F: Sorry, I don't think we have any at present.
