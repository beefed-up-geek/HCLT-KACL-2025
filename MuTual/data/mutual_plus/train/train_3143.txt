F: Sure, we can sit here. M: Gee, you've hardly got anything on your plate. F: Yeah, I guess I'm just not that hungry. M: What's the matter? Aren't you feeling well? F: Well, I've been really worried. It's my car. It's in the shop again. M: Really? What's wrong this time? F: I don't know exactly. Something's wrong with the brakes I think. M: Well, at least that shouldn't cost you much to fix. Parts are cheaper for all American cars like yours. Did the mechanic say how much it would cost? F: He said he would call me later today about the cost. M: Watch out, he doesn't try to take advantage of you. F: What do you mean? M: Well, some car mechanics, if they think that someone doesn't know much about cars, they might try to over charge that person. F: Maybe so, but I trust this man.
