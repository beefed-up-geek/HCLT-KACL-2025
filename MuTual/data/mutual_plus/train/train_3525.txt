M: Just a bit. Have you? F: Of course. I really started to like football since I came to London. Just think a year ago I was still in Montreal and didn't know a thing about it. M: Well, I'm from New Jersey. Americans aren't so into football, either. Actually we call it soccer. When Americans say football, what we mean is American rules football.

I think basketball players are some of the greatest athletes on earth. What they can do just amazes me. But when I watch a soccer match, I just get board. There aren't enough goals. F: Well, I see what you're saying. But there's so much more to soccer as you call it than goals. There are a lot of strategies involved.
