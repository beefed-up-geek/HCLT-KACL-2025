I should learn to be calm, like you, as panic doesn't help."], "article": "F: Oh, no. This can't be happening. M: I wonder what's going on. F: I'm going to ring the alarm. I told them weeks ago to check it. I would have been better off taking the stairs. M: Do you mean this has happened before? F: Yeah, it was a few weeks ago but I wasn't in here. Oh, if I'm in here a long time I don't know what I'm going to do. M: Well, for crying out loud. Don't lose your head. Calm down. F: You know I knocked myself out to be on time for an appointment. And now look. M: Complaining isn't going to help. F: How can you be so calm? Has this ever happened to you? M: No. This is my first time but why should I panic? What good would it do?
