M: No, it wasn't the teacher's fault. The problem is that I can't stay awake for a 2 hour lecture. I had been working in the evening at the hospital. F: Isn't that going to affect your grades? M: Probably, but I need to work to pay my school fees. F: Maybe you should talk to the financial aid office. There's no point in working so hard to make money, if you were just going to fail your classes. M: But they are going to try to offer me a bunch of loans. I am trying to avoid going into debt. That's why I've been working. F: OK, then I have a better idea. Why don't you go to the student employment office and see if they can help you find another job.
