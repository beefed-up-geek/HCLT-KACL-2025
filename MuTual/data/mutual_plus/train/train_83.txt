Anyway, your project is very amazed because they never complain about the food here.", "M: Ok, see you then. Anyway, your project is quite confused because I never worked in a cafeteria before."], "article": "F: Hi, Rob. Do you mind if I eat lunch with you? M: No, Mrs. Evans, not at all. F: Thanks. I've just heard you study nutrition and you've got quite a lot of experience working in the cafeteria, so I wonder if you are interested in a small project we're doing this term. M: What is the project about? F: More and more students prefer not to buy meals here and we want to attract them back. I want to know what the students would like to eat. Your job will be finding this out. Of course, I also like to hear any of your ideas. M: Well, if the menus were changed, maybe I wouldn't have to listen to so much criticism this term. You know, everyone in the nutrition class sees me when I serve food here, so they always complain to me about the food here. F: That makes you perfect for the project. Would you be interested? M: I'm not sure. What sort of changes are you thinking of? F: We'd like to make some changes in the way we prepare the food and we want to give students more choices. Do you think that will appeal to the students? M: Well, you're right. You'd better find out what they think. Oh, sorry. I've got to go back to work now. I'll drop in at your office later. F: OK. See you then.", "id": "train_83"}
