M: Oh, I'm sorry, is there something wrong? F: Yes, Christmas is coming, and it seems everything has been going wrong lately. M: Here, sit down and tell me about it. F: Well recently, I've had to be at work by 8:00 AM. You know, I work in the toy department at the shopping center. M: Ah, yes, of course, it's much busier than usual. Everyone's shopping for Christmas presents. F: Yesterday I overslept and I was 10 minutes late.
