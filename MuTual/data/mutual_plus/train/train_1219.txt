Tell me, how do you feel about talking to older drivers? M: They're happy to give advice if I needed. I always talk to drivers with more experience if I'm going to drive on a track I haven't raced on before. I try to get as much information as possible, so I don't make any mistakes. F: And what's the hardest thing for you about being a racing driver? M: I find it very difficult to take time off. I do go away on holiday probably not as often as I should, but the mistake I always make before a race is to push myself to keep training when I really should rest. When I train too much, I'm tired when the race actually starts.", "id": "train_1219"}
