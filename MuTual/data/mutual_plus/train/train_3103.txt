Please repeat it.", "F: OK, buy the 17.50 pounds ones, not having enough seats is not a problem, I am not going because I have to finish my homework."], "article": "F: Jack, our teacher let me ask you which circus tickets you've decided to buy.

And although there were lots of seats at 15 pounds 50, these were only on weekday afternoons, which I know wasn't suitable for us. So I'm afraid I've gone for the ones at 17 pounds 50. I know it's more than we wanted to pay. But at least we won't be right the back.", "id": "train_3103"}
