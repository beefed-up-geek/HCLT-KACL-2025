M: Well, I'm at a job at the moment and my wife and kids are expecting me home by 8:00 PM for dinner. F: I know it's Sunday evening. Can you at least suggest someone else who can work? I've been calling numbers in the phone books and you're the only one that answered. M: Just a moment. Don't worry. Where are you now? F: I'm at my office. I work in the morning side area. M: Well, you're in luck. I have to pass your area on my way home. Now I should be finished here by 7:30, so what about around 7:45? Is that OK? F: That's great. Thank you.", "id": "train_1250"}
