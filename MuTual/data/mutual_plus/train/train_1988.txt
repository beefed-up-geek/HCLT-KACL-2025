F: Not yet, are there a lot of changes? M: There sure are, instead of paying one feet to cover all meals for the whole school year. We are now able to choose how many meals a week we want, and can contract just for that amount. We still have to pay the whole year at the beginning, but we can choose to buy 7, 10, 14 or 21 meals per week. They give you a card with a number of meals you get each week marked on it. F: That's a big change Tom, and a complicated system. M: Yeah, but it will be much better for people who don't eat 3 meals a day 7 days a week in the cafeteria, because they don't have to pay for meals they don't eat. F: So, what's the deal for those who do eat at school all the time? M: It better for them, too, because the more meals you contract for, the cheaper each one is. F: I see, it still sounds rather complicated. M: True, it took me several hours to figure it out. I decided to go with the 10 meal plan.", "id": "train_1988"}
