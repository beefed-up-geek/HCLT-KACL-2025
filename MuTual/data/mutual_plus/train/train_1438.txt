{"answers": "A", "options": ["F: Well, you think Mrs. Green pays attention to little things and she is an energy saver, right?", "F: Why do you think Mrs. Green makes no contribution to the climate and she is climate-ignorant?", "F: Okay.  Mrs. Green uses high energy light bulbs but you still think she is an energy saver.", "F: Excuse me, could you repeat the question?"], "article": "F: Why did you decide to publicize climate change in this way? M: Well, I was really upset about some countries failure to sign up pollution control agreements. It felt like the science wasn't getting understood by the politicians, so I decided to look into what I personally could do, that led me to dream up a cartoon character called Mr Carbon. We all know somebody like him, he's climate ignorant and makes no effort to save energy. Of course, factories are the obvious bad character in the real world, but I couldn't do much about them. F: So, are we going to see him in scenes like we get in disaster movies? M: That's pretty unlikely, it's hard to make a box office success. But he certainly gives cause for concern. People are becoming more aware of the climate change. F: So you came up with the idea of another cartoon character, Mrs Green. M: Yes, now, she pays attention to little things, uses low energy light bulbs doesn't leave the TV on standby. Goes in for recycling. As well as making a contribution to the climate, she'll save $150,000 over her lifetime.", "id": "train_1438"}
