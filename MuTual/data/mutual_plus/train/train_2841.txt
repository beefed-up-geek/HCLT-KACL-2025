I have to stay here at the help desk since all the other librarians are very busy now. But I can show you a few places in the library here on this map. M: That would be helpful. F: OK. So we are here at the help desk, next to the service desk, where you go to borrow and return books. You can borrow up to 10 books each time. M: Yes, I see. F: Opposite the service desk is the training room, which is used by library staff to give training to staff and students on how to use the computer systems. The entrance to that room is round the other side. M: Is the training room beside the quiet room? F: Yes, that's right, with that entrance round the front too. It's important to remember that all mobile phones must be switched off in the quiet room. M: Of course, and what about books? Where can I find the books for my geography course? F: If you walk past the service desk, turn right...no, sorry, turn left, and continue on past the history section and biology section, you'll find the geography section. You should be able to find all the books you need there.", "id": "train_2841"}
