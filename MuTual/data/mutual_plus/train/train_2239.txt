Can you tell me how it happened? M: Sure. I was climbing the mountain in Nuremberg. Suddenly, the weather became really bad. There was lots of snow and we couldn't see anything. We got lossed. Well, we spent 4 days on the mountain. The temperature was 20 degrees below 0. We didn't have any equipment or food. F: So what happened? I guess somebody found you, right? M: Yes. But we were very sick. I couldn't move my legs because of the cold. I spent 2 months in the hospital. The doctors removed my legs. F: Right, so you lost your legs, but you want to try your best to stay active. M: That's right. In fact, I decided to make some new legs for myself.
