F: What I'd like to do for my survey project is to interview 3 people. Would that be OK? Because in class you said a survey is usually done with a large number of people. M: That's right, it is. But tell me about your idea. F: My idea is to interview 3 people in my host family. There is a grandmother, who has a lot of opinions about life. I want to compare what she says with what the mother and the daughter say. Would that be alright? M: It's a start. Why don't you prepare a list of questions? Maybe 5 or 6, but no more than 10 for your interviews. When you've done that, show me the list and we'll go from there. F: Alright. I'll work on it tonight.
