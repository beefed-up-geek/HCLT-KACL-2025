Her daughter Olyvia, appeared on the stage of London Palladium Theater in the musical, the Sound of Music last month. So how did it all come about? F: Well, until last year, the idea of her appearing at the London Palladium would have been unthinkable for our family. Things started to happen when Olivia got the leading role for the show Annie at the local theater. For Annie, Olivia had to learn more than 200 lines. She was on stage from most of the 2 hours show. I decided that we do 10 pages a night. After memorizing it, I gave her a line and she would have to tell me what the next line was. She picked it all up even better than her homework. M: And she did well in the part. F: She was great in the part. She had always been shy and she suddenly became less shy and more confident. A member of the stage management team for the show was taking over a local agency and asked her to sign up. So then she had an agent to represent her and try to get roles for her.", "id": "train_3152"}
