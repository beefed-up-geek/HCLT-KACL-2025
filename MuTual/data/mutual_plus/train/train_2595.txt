You spoke so rapidly that I did not catch the meaning of what you said. Could you repeat that?", "M: Why do you want to continue this habit?"], "article": "M: I was going to make myself some tea. Do you want some? F: No, thanks. I'm fine with my coffee. M: You know, it's not healthy to drink so much coffee. How many cups do you have every day anyway? F: More than 3 cups I guess. M: And do you put cream and sugar in your coffee? F: When I drink hot coffee, I always add cream and sugar, but when I drink iced coffee, I only add cream. M: Do you usually drink both hot and iced coffee in the same day? F: Well, I need at least 2 cups of hot coffee in the morning. Otherwise I just can't wake up. In the afternoon I like to have iced coffee, but I never have iced coffee after dinner. M: Don't you worry that you might get addicted to coffee? F: Um, I'm not worried at all. Look, I don't smoke. I don't drink alcohol and I don't buy a bunch of expensive stuff that I don't need. Therefore, I don't think drinking coffee is a dangerous thing in my life. And instead it has already become a habit of mine.", "id": "train_2595"}
