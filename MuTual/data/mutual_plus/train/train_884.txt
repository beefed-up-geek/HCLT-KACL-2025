I hear they're going to send you to Germany for the new project. M: Boy, news travels fast around here. I only got the orders a couple of hours ago. Rachel doesn't even know. F: Oh, no? So what are you waiting for? When do you plan to tell her? M: Well, she's at work at the moment. She doesn't finish until 5:00. I'll have to wait until tonight now, I suppose. F: Well, I was posted there before, back in two thousand and eight. It's OK. A bit like England really, at least the weather is similar and the people aren't much different. The only thing I didn't like is the food, especially the sausages. What do you intend to do about the family? Are you going to take them with you? M: Well, I'd like to, but I don't know much about the situation at the moment. You know about schools and all that, but I hope to move the family out there in a couple of months time. I don't think I want to spend a year and a half out there on my own. I mean, without Rachel and the kids. I mean, I don't see that much of them now as it is. F: Yeah.
