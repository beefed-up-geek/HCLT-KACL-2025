We should buy a big TV set instead of a small one.", "M: Excuse me, could you repeat the question?"], "article": "M: We've just moved into a new house. F: Really? Congratulations. M: Thank you. I think we want to buy a new television set. F: What kind of television do you want to buy? M: A color TV set, of course. But I'm not sure about the size. Maybe we should buy a big one.
