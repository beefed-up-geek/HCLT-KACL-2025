I just started writing my personal statement, but I'm having a hard time. F: What does it have to be about? M: It's basically just an essay about why I want to go to college and what I hope to do there. It's difficult to write, because I don't know what to major in yet. I know I want to go to college. I just don't have an idea of why I want to go. F: Why not just tell the truth in your essay? M: You mean I should write about the fact that I don't know what to do with my life? F: Yeah. I mean, I doubt if anyone really knows what career they want to have when they first go to college. You have years to figure that out. M: I guess I could write about that. F: What else do you need to do to finish your application? M: I need 2 recommendation letters. I asked my English teacher and my math teacher. Mrs. Watson turned hers in, but I'm waiting on my math teacher. I wanted to ask my drama teacher, Mr. Bennett, but I've only had one class with him, so I decided not to. I already turned in my grades and my SAT score.", "id": "train_1572"}
