M: Do you know the official registration code for that class? F: It is HIS107BC3. M: Um......It says that the class is full you could check back in a couple of weeks. Some places will probably open up by that time. There's a waiting list, and that means that you'd have to wait for your turn to come up. F: I understand. Well, one more question. Is the general housing office on the same floor as the registration office? M: Yes. In fact, I've got the number, so if you'd like, I can put you through.
