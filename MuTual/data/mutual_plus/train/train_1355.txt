Welcome to this week's People You Meet. Today, we present to you Mark Leach, an information officer in London. M: Hi everyone, my name's Mark Leach. I'm an information officer at the Britain Business Center, which is a tourist office for the British tourist board in London. Here, we offer a tourist information service to mainly visitors from overseas. And each year, we have about 500,000 people come to the office. F: Wow. That's a large number of people. How do you manage to meet the needs of so many people? M: I'm in charge of an information team. The team has about 10 officers who give tourist information directly over the counter to visitors. We speak a total of 13 languages altogether. F: That's pretty cool. So what exactly do you do everyday? M: Well, we act as a one stop shop for anyone who wants to come in. So it could be that they want a day trip from London, which is a very popular request. And we can offer suggestions of where to go and how to get there. If people want a two week tour of Britain, we can plan out exactly where to visit, what roads to take.", "id": "train_1355"}
