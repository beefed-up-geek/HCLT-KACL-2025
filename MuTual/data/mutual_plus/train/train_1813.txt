Please could you tell me again?", "M: My wife and I teach on work days, so we will leave our kids to you for $30 an hour.", "M: My wife is busy as a lawyer and me, too, so we appreciate your hard work, thank you."], "article": "M: Thanks so much for coming to our house. My wife and I really need someone to look after the children. After we had our first baby 6 years ago, my wife left her job as a lawyer to care for him. Then we had a little girl. That was 2 years ago. But my wife has decided to start teaching at a university, so we'd like to hire someone to watch them during the day. F: Well, I have a lot of experience taking care of children. I started baby-sitting my own little brothers and sisters when I was in middle school. I also looked after other people's children to make money when I was in high school, and last year I took the Red Cross safety course so I know basic first aid. M: Wow! You sound like you know what you're doing. If you want the job, we'll pay you $20 an hour. You should work three days a week. My wife only teaches part of the week so we don't need you all the time. F: That sounds perfect. I'll take the job.", "id": "train_1813"}
