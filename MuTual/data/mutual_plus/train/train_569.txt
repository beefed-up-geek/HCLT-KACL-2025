How are your exam preparations coming along? M: Good, Miss Swift. I've been working hard for it recently, I'm sure that the exam won't cause much trouble. F: Excellent. So are you working at the weekends now to get some pocket money? M: Yes, I'm very grateful to Mr. Lam, he really helped me with my problem.

F: Thank you, any suggestions as to how we can be even more fantastic?
