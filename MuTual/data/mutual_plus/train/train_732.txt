M: I just poured some ice water on Amy, while she was in the hot shower, you should have seen her face. F: You shouldn't tease your sister so much. M: Aaah it was just a joke mom. F: You take it too far sometimes Matt, if my brother had been like you when I was growing up, I would have gone crazy. Remember the time you replaced her toothpaste with hot pepper? And when you put salt in her cake, that was just before her tenth birthday. M: Sorry about that mom, that was a little too much. But Amy likes my jokes, she always laughs about it afterwards. F: She does have a good sense of humor. You are lucky she loves you so much. My brother and I weren't as close. He was 5 years older and if he teased me, I always felt hurt. It's good that you and Amy are only one year apart in age.", "id": "train_732"}
