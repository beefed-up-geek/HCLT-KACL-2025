M: I smell fresh baked bread. Did you just make some bread? F: Yes, but don't touch it yet. It just came out of the oven and needs about 20 minutes to cool down. M: I don't want it cool. I wanted hot from the oven. F: No, don't touch it. It's really still baking inside when it comes out. It needs time to finish. The bread will be too soft and sticky inside if you break it open now. M: But that's the way I like it. Hot and soft, hmm... I'll just take a small piece. F: Fine. If you like it that way, go ahead. But it's much better after it rests for a while. M: Don't worry. I'll eat it that way, too. Are we gonna have breakfast soon? What's cooking? F: Your favorite: fried eggs and sausage with mushrooms and onions. Why don't you go set the table for me and then make the coffee? The food should be ready in 10 minutes. Oh, put three plates out there, please. We have a visitor coming for breakfast. M: Who? F: My sister Kay. M: Hmm... There goes my appetite. Why is she coming over? F: You shouldn't be so rude. She's a nice girl, just a little depressed sometimes.", "id": "train_892"}
