Uh...I woke up really early at 5:30 AM and then I couldn't get back to sleep. So I got up. M: What? At 5:30 AM on a Saturday morning? F: Yes, then I had a shower and went out to catch a bus into town. Instead of 8 o'clock AM, it didn't come until 8:15 AM and it was raining hard. M: Oh, dear. What happened next? F: When I got to town, it was 9:15 AM. So first of all, I went to the library, but it was closed. So I waited until 10:00 AM for it to open. M: Why did you go to the library? F: I needed some information for my school project, but I spent 2 hours looking for something about the Kings and Queens of England. But all the books I needed were out of the library. M: Why didn't you go to the book shop in Stanley Street? F: I've didn't have enough money on me, so I caught the bus home at 12:30.", "id": "train_3040"}
