I do not quite follow what you are saying, would you mind repeating that?", "M: Fine, mom. I'll listen to the whole story. Don't miss any exciting part.", "M: Deal. You tell the whole romantic story, including the exciting part, and I'll listen to you."], "article": "F: And so the man with the dark mask rescued the princess from her kidnappers. After helping her off her white horse, the hero leaned over and kissed her. M: Wait! I don't want to hear about all that romantic stuff. Why do these stories always have to have kissing in them? Yuck, I hate that. Can't you skip over this part and get to the good stuff? F: Well, dear, I think that's enough reading for today. You look like you need some rest. Maybe you'd better go to sleep now. It's too bad, though, because we were just about to get to the exciting part. M: OK, OK. Let's keep reading. I want to hear about the fighting and what happens to the bad king. F: But I'm not going to skip parts of the story.
