{"answers": "D", "options": ["M: So you didn't know that the sun was that strong and none of you brought an umbrella, right?", "M: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t catch that. Would you mind speaking more slowly?", "M: What? None of you brought an umbrella and you just let the wind ruin the meal? That's terrible!", "M: You mean that the wind almost ruined the meal, but luckily you brought a large umbrella, didn't you?"], "article": "M: Today I'm talking to Marta Dancedand who runs her own mobile restaurant. Marta, how did you get into the restaurant business? F: Well, I learned to cook at college. I always wanted to open my own restaurant, but had no money so I got a job as a chef. I had all sorts of ideas for new dishes, which the staff thought would sell but the boss wasn't interested. That's when a friend told me about the mobile restaurant idea. It sounded great. M: Tell us about it. F: Well, it works like this. You decide on a menu. Obviously you have to be able to cook. Then you advertise it so people can book a meal. The most amazing thing is all the advertising is done through websites. People set up tables in their sitting room or in a city car park, an empty factory, anywhere in fact and because you know how many people you're cooking for, food doesn't get wasted. M: So why is it good for you? F: Well, various reasons, like I could buy all the things without risk because customers pay in advance. The greatest advantage, though, is by having 10 customers at most. I don't need to hire a waiter. M: Do you ever run into problems? F: The whole experience is fun. People watch you cook and the atmosphere is relaxed. I did one meal on a beach, which almost went wrong because I didn't think about the wind blowing sand into people's food. Fortunately, I brought a large umbrella to protect myself from the sun. So I put it around their table instead.", "id": "train_2636"}
