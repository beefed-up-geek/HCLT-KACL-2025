M: Well, I must admit some of the younger kids were a little bit unhappy, because they've never been away on their own before and didn't know some of the other kids. But soon they recovered. By the last day, they didn't want to go home because they were having such a great time. F: What sort of things did you do with them? M: Well, there were some trips, including a visit to Hardwick Castle. That was what we did on the first day. I think they were expecting it to be rather boring, especially when they heard they were having a guided tour. But they were wrong. The guide was very interesting. He told them some interesting stories and really made the history of the castle come alive. F: I can imagine. What sort of sports activities did they do? M: Ceiling, climbing, horse-riding and the like. And on the last day, we had a barbecue, which was their favorite. The kids enjoyed it very much. They all promised to come and get together again next year.", "id": "train_866"}
