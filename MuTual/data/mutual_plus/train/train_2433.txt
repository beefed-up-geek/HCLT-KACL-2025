M: But if we don't find a solution soon, we'll have to close it. And the zoo was part of the city. It's a tourist attraction. F: Yes, but that's the point. It simply isn't attracting enough tourists. You're going to have to find the money from somewhere else. M: But it's also an important place for animal conservation. Some of these animals are endangered. If we didn't have zoos, they wouldn't survive. F: I understand that, but we need to find a different solution. What if you advertised the zoo? In the newspaper or on the radio, for example. M: But if we don't have any money, we can't advertise. F: Well, why don't you try some other way? You know, ask a company to support the zoo. M: Actually, that isn't a bad idea. You might be right.
