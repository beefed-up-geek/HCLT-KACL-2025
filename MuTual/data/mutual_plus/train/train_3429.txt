Thanks. So how was your date the other night? F: Great. Jim took me to the cinema to see a film. I think he's really nice. And he's got a cool job. He's a television producer. You know, he went to the National Film and Television School and he's been working at Channel 4 for a year now. M: Sounds impressive. So you think it might get serious? F: Yeah, we have a good connection. I think he's marriage material. We'll see how it goes, but I'm already thinking we could have a long term future ahead of us. M: Isn't it a bit early to talk about stuff like that? You've only been out with him twice so far. F: No, we've been out 3 times now and I'm seeing him again tomorrow. It's not easy finding someone you're attracted to and have good chemistry with. I don't see what's wrong with thinking about the future. M: Well, I'd be careful if I were you. You should get to know him better before talking about marriage.", "id": "train_3429"}
