Could you repeat that?", "F: Glad to hear that you also admire people with real talent. That's why I like reality shows.", "F: Indeed. Our varied understandings of fame lead to different attitude toward reality shows.", "F: Reality show is such a new type of TV show that it leads us to different opinions on fame."], "article": "M: I'm tired. I went to sleep late last night. F: Did you work overtime again? M: No, I watched that new reality TV show till midnight. F: Oh, you didn't watch that rubbish, did you? It's just a group of people stuck in a house doing nothing. I have to admit it was attractive when it was new. But it's strange to think people are still watching the same shows nowadays. It seems to me that those shows just feed the big desire everyone seems to have for media attention. Everyone wants to be a star these days. M: But there are still some people signing up for those shows just to experience a different life or to earn some money. F: Anyway, I have no interest in these nobodies, whose idea of fame is that they were on a reality TV show. I admire people with real talent do actually earn their fame because they are different from the rest of us. M: Uhm, I don't think so in that way. Maybe we need to rethink what fame is.", "id": "train_3098"}
