It's too heavy looking. Is it comfortable? M: Try it. F: Uhm, It's really comfortable. And I'd like to have something this size. Our old armchair is way too small. This size is perfect. M: What do you think of the color? F: Well, green isn't my favorite color, but it's better than that terrible brown one we have now. It's OK I guess. But blue would be perfect. M: How much is it? F: Oh no, it's $999. That's really too expensive. We can't afford it right now. M: I know. Why don't we wait till next month for their midyear sale? It might be cheaper then.
