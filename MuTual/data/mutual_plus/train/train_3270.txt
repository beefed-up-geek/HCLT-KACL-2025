M: Oh, good morning, Miss Gear. Come in, please. We have talked on the phone. You'd like to rent the place? F: Yes, I'd like to have a look at this house. M: That's quite good. Let me show you around the place. How do you like the location? F: The place is very convenient. As it's only a 5 minutes' walk from the nearest bus stop. This must be the bedroom. Oh my God. I love the French window. M: I am very glad that you like it. F: The living room is big and the kitchen is OK. M: And this is a very safe building, too. F: That's good. The advertisement says the rent is $350 a month, right? Could you think about giving me a discount on the price? M: I am afraid I can't decide it.
