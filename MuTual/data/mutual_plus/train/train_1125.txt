I need help moving a new sofa into my house. M: Hey, Jennifer, no problem. I'm free this weekend and my truck is great for moving stuff. Where did you get the sofa? F: My friend Jack is moving next week, but his new apartment is very small. So he is giving me his sofa. M: It's good that your place is large enough to fit the sofa. Where will you put it? F: I have space in the living room. My current sofa is a little old and dirty, so I'm just going to throw it away. M: Yeah, my sofa gets dirty easily as well. Hey, I know Jack from work. Where is he moving? F: He is actually just moving across the street. Even though he won't have much space, he will have a great view. M: And you get a new sofa? F: Yup, it will be nice to get rid of my old one. M: Maybe Jack needs to get rid of some other furniture when he moves. F: I guess you can find out next week.", "id": "train_1125"}
