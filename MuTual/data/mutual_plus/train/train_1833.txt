You know what, I found a new way to learn Chinese and it works very well. M: You did? Do tell me. I've spent all these months trying to learn something new about it. But I've made little progress. F: Sure. I'm learning Chinese through songs. M: So you're learning Chinese songs? F: You can say that. I can actually sing some of them now. M: That's a real achievement. How did you do that? F: I start by listening to the song a few times and after several times I am able to follow the singer. M: It makes sense. F: It does. I've learned some Chinese folk songs this way.
