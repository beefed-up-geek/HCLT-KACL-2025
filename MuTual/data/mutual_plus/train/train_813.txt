M: I'm afraid I have a serious stomachache. F: There is nothing wrong with your lunch? What did you eat before that? M: You know I had bread and drank a little milk for breakfast. But that wasn't enough for me. I felt hungry. So I bought a cheeseburger and an ice cream. F: You ate that much shortly after breakfast? That's not good for you. What did you do after that? M: I had a PE lesson. We had a test and I needed to run quickly. I finished 200 meters in just 24 seconds. Here was a pretty good record. I felt thirsty after that, so I drank two cans of coke. Hmm, I ate a mango pudding afterwards. F: A cheeseburger, an ice cream, two cans of coke and a mango pudding, then you have your lunch with vegetables, meat and rice. No one eats in this way. It's ridiculous. No wonder you have a stomachache.", "id": "train_813"}
