Would you mind answering a few questions for our survey? M: No, not at all. F: Thanks a lot. First, could you tell me about travel arrangements for your last holidays? Did you experience any difficulties in your journey? M: Well, our plane didn't take off on time. It was delayed 5 hours. So we didn't get to Lhasa until 4:00 in the morning, and we were very tired when we got there. But we managed to book a car at the airport through a car rental platform. And it dropped us off at the hotel in time around 7:00 o'clock for breakfast, so that was alright. F: And how was the hotel? M: Well, we were a little disappointed with the room, but the Patella Palace was just a stone thrown away. F: And how important are holidays to you? M: Oh, we always look forward to going on a holiday. We always make sure we can get away at least once a year.", "id": "train_172"}
