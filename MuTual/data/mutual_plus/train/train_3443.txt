F: Don't worry. When you get to Waterloo, take the underground to Regents Park. I'll meet you there at the gate, which will be obvious when you get there. You can't miss it. By the way, when are you leaving? M: I am ready now. I'll get the... the 1138, a southern train, I think it is. That's non-stop to Waterloo and do I get the underground there? F: That's it. You will go straight there on the underground. You want the Bakerloo line to Regents Park. It's only about 4 stops. Make sure you get a northern underground though. You want northern Bakerloo, OK? M: OK, I'll be there soon.", "id": "train_3443"}
