Could you say it again?"], "article": "F: I think I want to go back to school, Paul. M: Well, that's a nice idea, Cindy. But what would you study? F: I'm not sure. I've always been interested in psychology. I think I'd do really well. M: Uh-huh, it's not that I don't believe in you, sweetheart. You were always a good student, but it's different when you're an adult going back to school. F: Well, I don't think I would have any problems making friends. Lots of older folks get a second BA degree later in life, just like I would be doing and besides I've always been young at heart. I'm sure I'd get along with the other students. And I think I'd be an even better rider and test taker now. Then when I went to college in my late teens and early 20s. M: Yeah, but that's not what I'm worried about honey. Have you given any thought to what you do when you graduate? F: I suppose I'd look for a job. M: And what do you know about jobs in the field of psychology? F: Not too much I guess, but I could start small and work my way to the top. M: That sounds like something a person might say about a big company on the Wall Street. Psychology is different. There just aren't that many jobs in that field right now and the ones that are out there don't pay much unless you have a PhD. I mean, we have 2 kids to feed, you know?", "id": "train_1930"}
