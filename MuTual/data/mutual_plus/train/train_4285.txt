We had dinner at home and then watched an old movie. When they told me it was almost 70 years old. I thought it was going to be boring. But it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I laughed, I cried, I got angry. M: Wow. Now I want to see it. F: I'm dying to watch it again. Hey, why don't we get together and have a party and we can see the movie together. M: That's a great idea. I can bring some friends, if that's OK. F: Sure. I'll ask my mom to watch it with us. She can tell us all about the stars. Let's say 6:00 o'clock on Saturday.", "id": "train_4285"}
