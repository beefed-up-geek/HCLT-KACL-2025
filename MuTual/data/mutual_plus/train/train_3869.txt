I'm just a bit tired this morning. That's all. M: Why is that? Did you stay up last night? F: Not at all, but I had this dream and it woke me up so I didn't get much sleep. I dreamt of walking through a forest at night. I couldn't see anything. M: That sounds frightening. F: In my dream, I saw white light behind some trees. It was a strange light because it seemed to get bigger and then smaller as if it was alive. At first I just stood where I was. But then the light seemed to move toward me and I could see something in it like the face of an old man. I tried to run away, but my feet felt very heavy, and I couldn't run fast enough. That's when I woke up I was shaking all over.", "id": "train_3869"}
