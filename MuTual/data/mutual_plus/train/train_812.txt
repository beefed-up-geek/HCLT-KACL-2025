M: I'm afraid I have a serious stomachache. F: There is nothing wrong with your lunch? What did you eat before that? M: You know I had bread and drank a little milk for breakfast. But that wasn't enough for me. I felt hungry. So I bought a cheeseburger and an ice cream. F: You ate that much shortly after breakfast? That's not good for you. What did you do after that? M: I had a PE lesson. We had a test and I needed to run quickly. I finished 200 meters in just 24 seconds. Here was a pretty good record. I felt thirsty after that, so I drank two cans of coke. Hmm, I ate a mango pudding afterwards.", "id": "train_812"}
