I haven't seen you in class for a week. Where have you been? F: Hi, Mr.Jones. I've been ill since last Sunday. In fact, I'm still not feeling well. M: Yes, I can see that. What was the problem? F: The doctor thinks it was food poisoning. I went to a nice restaurant for lunch with a few of my classmates last Sunday. It was a great meal. So many dishes, barbecued beef, roast mutton and lots of vegetables. M: Sounds delicious. F: Yeah, it was. But on my way home I got some fried chicken to eat from a street store. Not long after I got home I started feeling sick. M: Are you thinking that is what caused your illness? F: Well, it must have been. No one else who ate the lunch got sick. Anyway, I'm feeling a little better now. M: I'm glad to hear that, and are you able to keep up with all your lessons? F: Yes, my classmates have been bringing me their notebooks and I can download the biology lessons from the Internet.", "id": "train_2821"}
