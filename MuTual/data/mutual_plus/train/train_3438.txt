Please could you tell me again?", "M: Since I am going on my own. What shall I bring to her?"], "article": "M: Have you seen Kate recently, Vicki? F: Yes, I have. I saw her a couple of days ago. She hasn't been very well in the last couple of weeks. M: Has she seen a doctor since she's been ill? F: Yes, she has. The doctor told her to take it easy for a while. But she hasn't been taking his advice. She's as busy as usual. M: Do you think it's useful for me to ask her to have a rest when I go to see her? Or shall we go together? F: I think you can go yourself and show concern to her since she sometimes would take your advice. So it's unnecessary for me to go with you. What's more, I've got some other thing to do at the moment.", "id": "train_3438"}
