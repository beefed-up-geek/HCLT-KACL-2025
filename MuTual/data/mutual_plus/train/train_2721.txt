You spoke so rapidly that I did not catch the meaning of what you said. Could you repeat that?", "F: Don't worry about my safety. I can take good care of myself. I even managed to take bus here today.", "F: No worries. The public transportation is all perfect. You see, I took the bus home today and everything was timed well."], "article": "M: Why did you get home so late, Sarah? I was worried sick! F: I had everything timed perfectly. I sat in the coffee shop, waiting for Bus 55. It is supposed to leave at 4:45 sharp. I take it everyday at that time because it arrives at the Waterson Station just in time to catch Bus 15. M: And you lost track of time, didn't you? F: No, Ken, not this time. I was at the bus stop on time and I was picking up my bag and getting to my feet at 4:35. I was two feet from the bus when it suddenly left. M: 10 minutes early? F: Yes, so I had to wait 30 minutes for the next bus. By then, there were no more buses leaving from Waterson. M: How did you get here then? F: I walked. Can you imagine? Me, a young woman, walking in the dark for an hour by herself? M: And in this neighborhood! Next time, please call me. That was so dangerous.", "id": "train_2721"}
