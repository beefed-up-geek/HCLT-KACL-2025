F: Sure, we can sit here. M: Gee, you've hardly got anything on your plate. F: Yeah, I guess I'm just not that hungry. M: What's the matter? Aren't you feeling well? F: Well, I've been really worried. It's my car. It's in the shop again. M: Really? What's wrong this time? F: I don't know exactly. Something's wrong with the brakes I think. M: Well, at least that shouldn't cost you much to fix. Parts are cheaper for all American cars like yours. Did the mechanic say how much it would cost?
