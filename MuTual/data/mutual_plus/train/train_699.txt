I was doing laundry when I was half your age, your sister has been doing it since she was 10. So it's your turn to learn. M: Fine. It's just that there are so many buttons and settings. F: It's easy once you know how to do it. This is the load setting, choose small medium or large based on how many clothes your washing. I'm sure you can figure that out for yourself. M: I can do that. F: Good, next you choose the temperature, cold, warm or hot, just use cold for now. M: OK, and this spin cycle? F: That is for how fast the machine turns.
