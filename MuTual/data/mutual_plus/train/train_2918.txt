You spoke so rapidly that I did not catch the meaning of what you said. Could you repeat that?", "F: Well, that's a good idea, I'll prepare fresh fruit and cheese for dessert."], "article": "M: Can I be of any help? F: Oh, thank you, Sam. You can be a great help. You know Steve's parents will come to dinner today. This is the first time they have come to visit our new house since our marriage. M: Good. What would you like me to do? F: Well, I can't make up my mind about what to have for dessert. I made 2 apple pies last night but I tasted one of them this morning and it didn't taste good at all. M: You'd better make the pies over again if you don't want Steve's parents to make faces over there desert. F: Oh, they wouldn't do that. There are too polite. They would just make me as if nothing was wrong and then complain to Steve about it later. M: Look, why don't you just offer some fresh fruit and cheese for dessert? Steve's parents would probably like a healthy dessert.", "id": "train_2918"}
