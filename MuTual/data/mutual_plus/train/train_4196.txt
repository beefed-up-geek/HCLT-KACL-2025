At only 19, this Oxford student has already published a novel. He is a student in physics, but has a special interest in English writing. As you probably know, his novel is based on his childhood experience and is particularly popular among college students. Now, we are very happy to have Simon with us tonight. Simon, welcome to the program. M: Thanks. It's a pleasure to be here. I was lucky I suppose. Here I am now with a published novel on my first attempt. F: So could you tell us more about your novel? M: Well, it's called My Diary and it's kind of an everyday story of my life and schooling in South Africa. You know, my father is a news reporter and I stayed there with him for 3 years. F: We learned that while studying at Oxford, you worked as a volunteer in Vietnam during summer vacations. Are you going to make what you are learning from Vietnam, the subject of your next novel? M: I can't say at the moment. I'm afraid. I'm very much interested in the history of Vietnam, though. I plan to work there when I graduate.", "id": "train_4196"}
