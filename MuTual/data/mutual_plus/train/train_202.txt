M: When I got my first job back in nineteen eighty two and started traveling, I had no other choice but to eat out. I found that I felt different due to what I was eating, so I try to find places that served food that made me feel good. The secret was the quality of the food and how well the food was prepared. I made an effort to find good restaurants as well as nice dishes. F: How did you manage to make a list of 218 favorite restaurants? M: I have lived in many cities.
