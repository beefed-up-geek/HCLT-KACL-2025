Sorry.", "M: I am really sorry, I did not catch that. Would you slow down, please?"], "article": "M: Can I help you, madam? F: Yes. Did you have this room checked before we moved in? The toilet doesn't seem to have enough power and the water doesn't flow away in the shower. What do you have to say to that? M: I'm extremely sorry to hear that. I'll attend to it right away. We usually check every room before new guests move in. We've been busy with a large conference. F: That's not what you should do after all. One doesn't expect this sort of thing here. M: No, madam. I do apologize. It's most unusual. We do try to check the room as thoroughly as possible. Anything else? F: Well, your air conditioning doesn't seem to be working too well. It's so hot up here.", "id": "train_3660"}
