I hope we can have a nice housemate next time.", "F: Excuse me, could you repeat the question?", "F: Tom will be gone in 5 weeks and we need to find a new babysitter."], "article": "F: In the end, we chose David. He wasn't ideal but there was nobody else who we interviewed that we liked. M: But we really regret it now. He's really antisocial. He stays in his room all day reading. F: True, it's like he feels superior to us. M: He doesn't leave his dirty clothes around. That's one good thing I suppose. F: And the food he makes is disgusting. I'd like to share meals, but with him, it's impossible. He only eats frozen rubbish and then sometimes he takes my food without asking which is annoying. M: He always gives his opinions about smoking when I smoke, as if he was the adult and I was the kid. F: The other day, I caught him kicking one of the cats. Poor thing. M: At least he's going soon. There's only 6 weeks left.", "id": "train_3385"}
