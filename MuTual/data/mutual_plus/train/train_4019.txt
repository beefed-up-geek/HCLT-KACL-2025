M: Yeah, thanks again for the invitation. I was worried I'd have to spend it alone after my parents announced they'd be in Finland. F: I think it's strange that you're not going with them. Is it because of the cold weather in Northern Europe? M: Not exactly. I have a lot of work to do next week. F: Well, I'm glad you won't be alone on a holiday. It'll be great to have you celebrate with us. The more the merrier! M: Exactly, how many people will be there? F: Let's see, my parents, my grandpa, my sister, my brother-in-law, my niece and my two cousins, plus us. So, ten people altogether. M: Should I bring anything? F: Nope, we've got it covered. M: Come on, I hate to show up empty-handed. You are being so generous to have me. I know! I'll bring pie. I'll make a great pumpkin pie. F: Sounds delicious, but my sister has already volunteered for dessert. Look, don't worry about it. There will be tons of food. Turkey, stuffing, green beans, sweet potatoes. M: Wow, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. How about this, I'll bring a nice bottle of wine. You can never have too much of that.", "id": "train_4019"}
