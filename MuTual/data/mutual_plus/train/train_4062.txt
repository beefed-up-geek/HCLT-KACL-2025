Come on, tell me all the details. F: Well, I was watching the pool from my chair, like I always do. There was a group of kids taking diving lessons in the deep end. M: Go on. F: I guess one of the students hit their heads on the diving board, because I saw that someone was sinking to the bottom of the pool. M: So what did you do next?
