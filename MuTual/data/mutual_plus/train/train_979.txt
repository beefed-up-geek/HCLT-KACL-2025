F: Sorry Bill, I'm not into cakes at the moment. I thought you knew about my diet. M: On your birthday? Surely you can eat whatever you want on your birthday, you can start your diet tomorrow. And anyway, you look great. F: Well, thanks Bill, I am not on a diet to lose weight, actually. My doctor told me to stop eating certain foods. I'm trying to avoid being allergic to something. M: I didn't know food could help with that. I also noticed you didn't eat any of the sandwiches Jill brought. F: Yeah, and you and Tom and Sharon all brought different cakes. I'm dying to try them.", "id": "train_979"}
