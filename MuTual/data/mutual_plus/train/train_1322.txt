M: It was great in the end, but we had a terrible time at the beginning. F: Why? M: First, we left the house early on Saturday morning, but after only half an hour my car broke down. F: Oh, no. M: Fortunately, there was a garage nearby, and the repairman fixed the problem. But when we arrived at the forest, it was getting dark. We drove around the forest for about an hour and finally found the camp side. But it was completely dark by then. Unfortunately, it started raining, so we drove down the road for 2 hours and found a hotel. F: That was lucky. M: Yes, it was a great hotel. And in the end, we stayed there for the whole weekend.", "id": "train_1322"}
