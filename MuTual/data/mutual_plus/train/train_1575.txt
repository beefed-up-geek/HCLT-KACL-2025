Would you slow down, please?", "F: I am not excited by their speed because I think they are not safe at all.", "F: Are you serious? I don't understand why you feel scared by them."], "article": "M: Would you consider buying a self-driving car? F: I don't know. I guess I'd have to research a bit more about them before making that decision. M: It will probably be a while before we are able to buy them anyway. We might be seeing self-driving trucks on the road pretty soon, though. Google wants to change the commercial trucking industry. Right now, there are over 3 million truck drivers in the US, so adding self-driving trucks would likely take away a lot of jobs. But many drivers might still be able to accompany their trucks and get a full night's sleep in the process. F: Truck drivers cause a lot of accidents on the freeway, so I think I'd like to see self-driving trucks. It would make me feel safer on the road. M: Really? I think it might make me feel less safe. A human driver is much more likely to react quickly to something unexpected.", "id": "train_1575"}
