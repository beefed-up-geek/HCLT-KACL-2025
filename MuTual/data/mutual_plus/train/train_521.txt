M: Hi, I've been trying to order some of your software from the website, but there seems to be a problem, because my order didn't go through. F: Oh. I'm sorry about that, Sir. There was a problem with the site this morning. That's probably why you had some difficulty. M: Would it be possible for me to place my order through you now? I don't want to wait until tomorrow as I'll be out seeing customers. F: OK, now then. What would you like to order from us? M: Your site had a great sale on something called Viva Voce. The price was $180.25 percent off the normal price. F: Well, I'm afraid that price is only available for those of our customers who order through our site, you'd pay $240. M: I just tried to order through your site, and as I told you, the sale wouldn't go through. Can't you give me that discount anyway? F: Yeah, I think that would be alright.", "id": "train_521"}
