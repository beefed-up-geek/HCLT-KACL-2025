And did you study education in college? M: No, I studied construction. Actually I worked as a designer when I was younger. That was a really great job. But I kind of came into teaching just to try something different. F: Do you like electronic products? M: Yeah, I do. My favorite is my laptop. I think everyone should have a laptop now because it's so useful. I can watch movies, download music from the Internet and most important, I can write reports on my students on my laptop. It's just amazing what you can do today. F: Any other products you especially like? An MP4 player or an iPad? M: No, I suppose I would have to say my digital camera. I'm absolutely useless had taking photographs. I always miss the main part of the picture, however, with a digital camera, I can keep taking photos again and again until I know I've got the one I actually want. The digital Camera is perfect for me. I can choose only the photos I want.", "id": "train_1675"}
