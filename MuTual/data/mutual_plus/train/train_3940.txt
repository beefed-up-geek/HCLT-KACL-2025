{"answers": "B", "options": ["M: So it's small and has good transportation, making moving convenient, though you prefer LA.", "M: I am sorry. You spoke so rapidly that I did not catch the meaning of what you said. Could you repeat that?", "M: Oh, there is no cable cars in San Francisco, but the subways make things more convenient.", "M: I see. Though San Francisco is bigger, it has smaller population, making the traffic easier."], "article": "M: Hi, Jane. Welcome back. How was the west coast? F: Terrific. I had a wonderful time. It was really nice to get away from the city for a while. M: What did you think of Los Angeles? F: It was alright. I liked it better than I thought I would. It's very clean and spacious and it's got a lot of trees. The problem is transportation. The bus service is terrible and of course, they don't have any subway, so it's a little difficult to get around. We had to rent a car. M: And was the weather good? F: Oh yes, it was nice and warm in Los Angelus and cool, but comfortable in San Francisco. M: Cool in San Francisco? Not surprising? F: Yeah, it surprised me a bit too. We didn't take any sweaters or anything. And they say it's always like that in August. Anyway, I loved it. It's probably the most beautiful city in the US. All those hills, the bay and those charming old Victorian houses. M: So you like it better than Los Angeles? F: Oh yes, there is much more to see and do, and because it's smaller than Los Angelus, it's a bit easier to get around. There are lots of buses and streetcars and of course, the cable cars, too.", "id": "train_3940"}
