We must have a surprise party. F: A party? Do you mean you want to have loud music and food everywhere? M: Well, no, but grandpa will. You know he loves jazz. F: OK, well, how about having it at a hotel? M: Hotels are expensive, and it's too cold for a garden party at this time of year. We really should have it here at our house. F: Ok, I suppose you're right. What food should we have? M: Oh, I'll make some pizzas, and I'm sure grandma will make a birthday cake. F: Yes, I'm sure she will. I'll make some salad, then. What do you think I should get him? M: Let me think. No scarves or hats. I'm giving him a scarf and grandpa just bought a hat last month. What about a book? He reads a lot. F: Ok, good idea. Oh, what day should we plan to have the party? M: Well, the birthday is on Thursday. So we could do it on Friday. No, Saturday. Saturday is the best day for a party.", "id": "train_3728"}
