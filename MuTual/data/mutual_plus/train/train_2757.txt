I was waiting for you at the theater. Why didn't you meet me there? M: I thought we were supposed to meet here. F: Don't you know our movie starts at 7:00 and we were going to meet at the theater at 6:45. Then it doesn't make sense to meet at the apartment. M: I'm sorry, we must have misunderstood each other. F: Why don't you try to be clearer about our appointment? M: You're right, I am sorry. Let's go and watch the movie. F: I don't want to go now. We've already missed 10 minutes of the movie.
