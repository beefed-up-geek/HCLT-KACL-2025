I didn't mean to hit your car. My baby was crying in the backseat. I got a little concerned and took my foot off the brake a bit. M: That's OK. It doesn't look like there is much damage. F: I guess I should get you my license and insurance information. Hold on a second. M: Let's pull over to the side of the road. So we can let these people behind us get by. F: Good idea. OK, here is my information. Should we call the police? Oh, I've never been in an accident before. This is going to make my monthly insurance costs go up. M: I'll tell you what. I have a scratch on my passenger side door that will cost me about $100 to get fixed. Why don't we keep the insurance company out of this? F: Would you do that? That is so kind. Are you sure you don't want more? M: I have kids and bills to pay, too. I know what it's like. F: Here, take $150. That's all I have. M: Fine.", "id": "train_2412"}
