{"answers": "D", "options": ["F: Yes, I agree with you. Formal language makes an excellent article. That's one of the four key points you mentioned, right?", "F: That's right. If you want to write an excellent article, you should keep in mind the fifth point the professor mentioned, detailed facts.", "F: Although personal style won't touch the readers' feelings, just like you said, it makes an excellent article.", "F: I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t understand. Could you say it again?"], "article": "F: This is Word Master on Radio 4. Today we have Professor Danny Sheffield from Arkansa Community College. OK, Danny, could you tell us how to produce a good piece of writing in college? M: Well, one of the basic things about any writing is to remember 3 key points. Number One, say what you're going to say. So you're telling the reader what you're going to write about and maybe also your opinion in the beginning part. The second thing is say it. And here's where you provide details and facts to support what you have stated. And the third part is say it again. Conclude the main parts of your article and restate the key points that you've made and what you want your readers to understand. F: But what really separates an excellent article from the average ones? M: I would say it's a personal voice, because people respond to such an article much more easily. So if you want to touch the readers' feelings, your natural voice will help. That puts your writing more into the excellent type rather than \"Oh, this is a good formal article\".", "id": "train_2129"}
