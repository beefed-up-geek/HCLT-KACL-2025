F: Randy Bedford, Oh my goodness. You look exactly the same. Even your hair is the same, curls everywhere. M: Well, you look a lot different. But I mean that in a good way. F: Well, I got tired of that blonde hair. So I decided to become a redhead. I also lost a lot of weight. I don't want to look like I did in high school ever again. M: So what do you do? F: I'm a lawyer in Brookefield. I just come out here on weekends to do my shopping. What about you? M: I sell insurance, but I'm actually working in Springfield, where to open a new office here in Irvington. So that's why I'm out here. F: Do you like your job? M: Well, I guess I make a nice living. But it's really boring work. I wish I could just change careers. F: I agree. I actually have the opposite problem. I work for an environmental law firm, so the work is exciting. The only problem is that the pay is quite low. So I'm basically living hand to mouth every month.", "id": "train_2115"}
