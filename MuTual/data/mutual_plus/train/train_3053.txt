F: No, Black. I'm waiting for a package to be delivered. M: This is why I hate shopping online. It would be faster to just get what you want from the store. Now you have to sit here all day. Isn't Mom home? F: No, Mom went to work. M: Just download an app to keep track of your package. You can just come back when you get a delivery notice. F: No, thanks, Mr. Bossy. Even if they leave the package for a short time, someone could steal it. M: Goodness! You just don't want to be seen with your little brother! F: It's not that. I really did plan to stay home and wait for this package. Why don't we just have pizza delivered? M: Great. More waiting.", "id": "train_3053"}
