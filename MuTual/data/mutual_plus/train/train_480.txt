M: Anyway, we have a 2 o'clock appointment to see the one on Main Street. I'm sure you will agree with me this time. F: Really? M: Yes, the manager said it's an upstairs unit. F: That's good. I don't want to live under people with loud feet. M: And it's a corner unit. F: That's great. We won't have neighbors on both sides of us. M: No pets are allowed. F: Perfect.
