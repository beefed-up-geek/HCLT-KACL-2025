Well, actually I think grammar is the hardest part of learning French for me.", "M: Really? You mean it can not be very confusing? Oh, actually I think writing is the hardest part of learning French for me."], "article": "M: French is so hard, do you know what's the most difficult part for me? F: The grammar? M: Yes, but only one particular area. I can't remember if a word is male or female. F: You have to just remember those. M: But there are so many and I can't find a pattern. For instance, the moon is female and the sun is male. I know those are common in different languages, but a chair is female and hair is male. I think that hair would be considered female. I just don't get it. F: It can be very confusing, don't let it get you down, Andy. You're doing well this term. One bad quiz score will hardly affect your grade. Your reading is excellent and so is your writing, you'll get used to this part of the language soon enough.", "id": "train_736"}
