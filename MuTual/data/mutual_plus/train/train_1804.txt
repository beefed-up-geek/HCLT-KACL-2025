Would you mind speaking more slowly?"], "article": "F: Good afternoon, and welcome to You and Your City. Every week we speak to a teenager from a different place. Tonight, we're speaking to 17-year-old Dave, who lives in London. Hi, Dave! M: Hi, Lillie! F: Dave, everyone knows that London is an exciting city for tourists. But what's it like for a teenager living there? M: Oh, London is a great city to live in. I study at a local school and at the weekend, like all teenagers, hang around with my friends. F: What do you do? M: Lots of things. We go to cinemas and clubs. But what I like most is the park. At the weekend, the park is crowded with joggers and footballers. In fact, I play football there every Sunday morning with my mates. F: What else do you enjoy doing? M: Well, London's famous for its entertainment. There's always a music or street festival on somewhere. I really enjoy those kinds of festivals. Actually, next week, there's going to be an international Jazz festival, and if you're into theaters museums or gallery's there are plenty of those around. But to be honest, that's not really my things. Oh, of course, there are lots of good restaurants. But I seldom go there. They're too expensive for me.", "id": "train_1804"}
