But we've been in the same class for the past 2 years and you've never even spoken to me before. F: Yes, I know. We seldom have the chance to talk. I'm always playing with my friends and having fun, while you always have your face in a book. M: Yeah. Well, I guess I can come. Thanks. Actually, I do feel like relaxing. I have been working all week on science project. F: Really? I haven't even started it yet. Science is so boring. M: You haven't started it yet?
