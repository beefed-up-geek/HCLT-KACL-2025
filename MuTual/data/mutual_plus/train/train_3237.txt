I haven't seen you around much. Where have you been? M: Oh, I was playing the piano for a group of Germany. I just got back. F: It must be exciting to play the piano and travel all the time. M: Well, playing the piano is great, but the traveling is no fun. I have just been to my manager. And he has offered me a job playing on the coast for the summer. F: A seaside town? M: Yes, but I don't think I'm going to take it. F: Why not? Not enough money? M: No, it's not bad. The money is good. About $200 a week. It's just that we will be working in the hotel, playing for the tourists and they just want the same old music over and over to dance to. And I get so bored. It's not like playing the music. It's like being a machine. F: I wouldn't mind being a machine for that money.", "id": "train_3237"}
