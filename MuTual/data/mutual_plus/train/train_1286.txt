F: Well, you know, Nancy and I moved into an off-campus apartment in the fall, over on the west side of the town. Anyway, we've been happy with it until the last couple of months. M: Sounds good, then what happened? F: Unluckily, the air conditioner broke down. So we report it to Mr. Green, the landlord. He promised he'll take care of it, but a month went by, and nothing happened. M: Did you make contact with him again? F: I got a repair person to give me an estimate, then I send it to Mr. Green. When I didn't hear from him, I had it repaired down and I took all the cost from the rent check. M: So, what's the problem? F: He called me in a mad way, he said he could have gotten it repaired down for less money. Now he's threatening to drive us out for not paying the full rent.", "id": "train_1286"}
