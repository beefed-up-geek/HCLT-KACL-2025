We should choose a cheap one.", "M: You are right. They are coming here for a graduation ceremony and they care about the time most.", "M: Sure. We will book a non-stop flight for my parents since they care about the stops most."], "article": "M: I need to book a flight online. Can you help me? F: Sure. I use a website called Kayak.com. That compares the prices of many different airlines. They also have a cool quality where you can look at flights a few days before and a few days after your scheduled dates to find the best price. M: Oh, that quality is very useful. But this is for my aunt and uncle, and their dates are fixed. They're coming out here for my sisters wedding. But they have to fly out the day before and leave the day after. F: I see. Where are they coming from? M: New York City. Oh, it's not a very long flight. Do you think they care more about prize or convenience? F: They definitely want a non-stop flight. They had a bad experience changing planes in Philadelphia once. So they only fly non-stop now.", "id": "train_1511"}
