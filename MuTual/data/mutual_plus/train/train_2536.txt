F: OK, let me see. I'm sorry, sir. I'm afraid we can only give you a room for 2 nights. It's a very busy period right now. We're almost fully booked these days. M: Alright. I'll just stay for tonight then. It's too late to go to other hotels now. I'll search for another one tomorrow. F: That's an excellent idea, sir. And thank you for your understanding. So a single room for one night. Here is your key card and your room is on the seventh floor. M: Thanks. By the way, is there a swimming pool in the hotel? F: Yes, there is. It's on the fifteenth floor, but it closes at 10:00 PM. So it was closed 45 minutes ago already. M: That's too bad. F: We do have a gym that opens 24 hours. It's on the fourteenth floor. M: Great, thanks for letting me know. F: You're welcome, sir. Oh, before I forget, breakfast deserved on the second floor from 6:30 to 10:00 in the morning.", "id": "train_2536"}
