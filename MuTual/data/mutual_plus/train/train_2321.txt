M: Well, everyone has been talking about having a barbecue down by the river. So why don't you pick up some hamburger and hot dogs? F: OK, but how much hamburger meat are we going to need? And hot dogs, too. M: I don't know. How about 3 pounds of hamburger and a couple of packages of hot dogs? F: Oh, that's not going to be enough. Do you remember the last picnic in the mountains? Jim, your roommate, ate about 10 hamburgers by himself. M: Yeah, I remember that. Then 7 packages of hot dogs should be enough. And you'd better pick up some chicken for those who don't like hamburgers or hot dogs. F: OK. How about 5 or 6 bags of potato chips. M: Better make that 8. F: OK. Uh, we still need some soft drinks. How about 10 of those 2 liter bottles? M: Sounds fine. But be sure to buy a variety of drinks. F: OK. And what about dessert? M: Well, maybe we could ask Kathy to make a few cherry pies like she did last time.", "id": "train_2321"}
