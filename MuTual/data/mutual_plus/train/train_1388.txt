I saw your ad in the local paper and I'm wondering what kinds of bikes you have, and what your prices are like? M: Well, we hire out 3 main types of machine, electric touring and mountain bikes. Are you likely to be riding off-road, do you think? F: No, I'll probably be sticking to roads. So, we're touring bike would be best. M: Right, well the rate will be 50 pounds for a week or 14 pounds per day. F: So it's a lot cheaper to rent by the week. Is there anything else I'd have to pay? M: Well, for another 5 pounds, we can supply lightweight bags. There is no charge for things like a pump or for a lock. It's a good strong one, just make sure you don't lose the key.
