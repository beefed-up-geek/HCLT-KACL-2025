Since I'm your wife, if you don't want to send a present to your sister Linda, forget it.", "F:  Oh, brother, why don't you want to send Linda a present?", "F: You're welcome.

F: I'm much better now. Thank you. M: What was the matter? Nothing serious I hope. F: Oh, no, I had a bad cold and had to stay in bed for 2 days. M: I'm glad you're better. Anyway, I hope it was the last cold of the winter and not the first cold of the summer. What about your friend Dan? I hear she's ill, too. F: She was ill, but she's all right now. I think she caught my cold. M: Everybody seems to have one now. I expect it's the sudden change of weather, 1 day hot and the next day cold. F: And very windy, too. That's why I'm wearing a sweater today. What do you think of it? Pretty, isn't it? M: It certainly is. It must have cost a lot. Where did you find it? F: Oh, I got it at a sale. It was quite cheap. M: Really? Well, Mary, I must say it suits you very well. What a pity we men can't wear beautiful sweaters. F: Never mind. Let's go and buy one like it to send to your sister Linda in America. M: Now that's very kind of you, Mary. I'm really thinking of sending her a present.", "id": "train_4256"}
