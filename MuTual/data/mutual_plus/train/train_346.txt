M: It was fun. I took the train there. F: I didn't know that a train went from Los Angeles to New York. M: Well, it doesn't go there directly.

F: How long did that part of the trip take? M: 45 hours. F: Then how long did it take to get from Chicago to New York? M: Another 20 hours, this time I had a window seat, and the view was amazing! High stayed up just to look, by the time I arrived in New York. I was exhausted! F: Would you recommend traveling that way? M: I think it's a great way to see the country, trains often travel near the coast or through other beautiful areas.
