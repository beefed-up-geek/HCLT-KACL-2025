These are the washing machines. Those big things over there are the dryers. M: I see. Do the machines have soap in them? F: No, of course not. You have to put soap in. Did you bring your soap? M: No, I don't have soap. F: Well, you can buy some over there. M: Thanks. OK, I have my soap. F: My god, you really bought a lot. Why do you need so much? M: I don't know. I want my clothes to be clean. F: But you can't use so much. The machines won't be able to remove the soap completely. On the contrary, too many bubbles trapped dirt, allowing bacteria to build up.
