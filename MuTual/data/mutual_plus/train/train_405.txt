Are you good at winter sports then? M: Yeah! I love winter sports very much, such as skiing and snowboarding. I also like ice diving. F: Wow, that sounds quite exciting! M: Yeah, I've been doing that for 7 years since I was 9. What do you do in your free time? F: Well, swimming used to be my favorite hobby. But now I spend most of my spare time in the acting club I joined last year, and I really love the theater. I really want to be an actress one day. Have you got any other hobbies? M: Uhm, I guess I enjoy playing online computer games. I feel quite relaxed when playing the games, and it helps me make new friends. How about you? Do you spend much time online? F: Well, I'm not interested in computer games. I think it makes no sense spending time playing something with strangers. I prefer chatting face to face with my friends.
