Since I was only a few blocks from Main Street, I went over to Martins. Did you know that Martins has gone out of business? I'm not happy about that. F: That's too bad, but I'm not surprised. A lot of family owned shops are closing because of the construction of shopping centers. M: Yeah, and don't forget about all the big stores that are being built too. The reason why people prefer to shop there is to save money. Everyone loves shopping centers in big stores due to the low prices and the huge selection. F: Not me. I loved Martins for their beautiful clothes and friendly sales people. When you were there, you almost felt like family.
