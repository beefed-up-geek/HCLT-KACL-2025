My best subject was history and my second best was geography. However, my favorite subject was math and the results I got in my math paper were often quite good. F: Do you think that these subjects will help you get this job? M: Of course. I understand that you produce computers and prepare software, and working with computers needs a logical mind rather than great skills in math. That's especially true when it comes to writing programs. And I think my results show that I have such abilities. F: I see. Well, I've enjoyed our talk. We'll inform you of our decision in a week.", "id": "train_2353"}
