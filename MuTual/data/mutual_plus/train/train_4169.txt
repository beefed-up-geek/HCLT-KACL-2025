I often think of you and your former classmates. You were one of my favourites students. How are you getting along at college? M: Very well. I love my life here and I am involved in many activities. We are planning to set up a new arts and literature center here. The center is going to have 3 sections, a theater and dance studio, a literature room and an exhibition gallery. I need your help because I have no idea what we should have in the literature room. Could you give me some suggestions? F: Certainly. You should have works by famous writers, like Jane Austen, Shakespeare and Mark Twain. But you should also have some newer books, like Harry Potter, books of poetry are necessary, too. I also suggest that you set up a readers club. M: That's a good idea. I'll make a list of the books and email them to you. Please add some others to the list if you have a chance.", "id": "train_4169"}
