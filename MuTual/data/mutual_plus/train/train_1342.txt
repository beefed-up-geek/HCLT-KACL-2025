It will be quite expensive if you stay there all day. M: Yes, we're thinking of going to look around some of the shops, and look at the wall around the city. So we'll probably be there most of the day. F: In that case, you'd better take a taxi or the bus. M: How much does taking a taxi cost? F: It will be about 12 pounds. Actually I'd say it's around 16 pounds, because fares have increased recently. We can book it for you in our travel agency and it will pick you up outside. It only takes about 10 minutes. M: Right, I see. What about taking the bus? How much is that? F: It's only 2 pounds per person, it's not far from here. You go out of here, turn right on Oak Tree Avenue, and it's about a 5 minute walk down the road. The bus ride is about 15 minutes. M: Oh, OK, maybe we could do that.", "id": "train_1342"}
