Got any plans after the class? F: Not really. What about you? M: We will have our midterm exams next month. I plan to look for some important books and study at the library. Do you want to join me? F: Sure. I need to return some books. They're due today. Besides I can also read some weekly magazines and newspapers. M: Great. We can go to the swimming pool in the gym after that. F: That sounds like a good idea. We can cool down a little in such a hot summer. Are you good at swimming? M: Well, that's a good question. I haven't swam for almost 2 years. I think I need more practice. F: Oh, it's almost 9:00 AM. I need to hurry. I am running late now. See you after class in front of the library then. Bye. M: See you then.", "id": "train_1840"}
