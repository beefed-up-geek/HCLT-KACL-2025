It's very difficult for her, because my father and my sisters all live here in Florida. So she doesn't want to leave us. M: Does she ever go to visit her family in India? F: She goes back once a year to visit her family and old friends. But, when she's in India, she misses her family in the United States. M: It must be very hard for her to always be torn between 2 places. F: Yes, it is. And she's always telling us not to forget our Indian culture.
