M: Really? F: Yeah, 5 of us. Why don't you join us? We're getting to Keswick on Friday. Then we're going boating on Saturday and on Sunday. We're going to do some shopping. Then I will take some time to visit my aunt Lucy. M: You're not going to camp, are you? Isn't it a bit cold? F: No, we are not. It is a bit cold. We're staying in a country inn. It's not like 5 star hotels or anything, but it's really comfortable. M: Sounds interesting. You know it's the boating that I don't like. F: Well, what are you up to? M: Sit on my sofa all weekend and watch the DVDs I've just bought. And that will be a busy weekend. I may finish watching friends. F: I don't know how you can do that all weekend Gordon.
