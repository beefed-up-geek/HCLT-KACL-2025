No one else is sick except me.", "F: So you think the restaurant has a food safety problem?", "F: I am really sorry, I did not catch that. Would you slow down, please?", "F: Do you think this restaurant doesn't need to be investigated ? Why? Five people all had the same situation in a short period of time."], "article": "M: You look rather pale. Are you feeling well? F: Not very. I was sick most of the night. I didn't sleep very well. M: What seems to be the matter? Is it the flu? F: No, I think it was something I ate. We ate at that new restaurant last night and I must have eaten something that didn't agree with me. M: Was it that new restaurant over on fourth street? F: As a matter of fact it was. Why do you ask? M: Jerry ate there last week and had the same kind of problem. He was sick the next day, too. F: Maybe the health authorities should investigate the place. M: That's what I think. 2 people having similar problems in such a short time can't be a coincidence.", "id": "train_4277"}
