Walk to Fire Square and then Rainbow Avenue.", "M: Not exactly. But I'm driving my car. I can quickly get to Fire Square and ask."], "article": "M: Excuse me Madam, can you tell me how to get to Sun College? I'm walking. F: Well, I think the simplest way for you is to go up to main street over there, turn left on main street and keep going for about 20 minutes. When you get to water square, turn right, keep on past the mass hospital to the end of the road, and then take a left turn. You'll be on Rain Avenue. Walk 2 blocks until you see the farmers bank. Cross the street and almost immediately take a left turn, again. The entrance to Sun College is down a few yards on your right, can you remember all that?", "id": "train_1950"}
