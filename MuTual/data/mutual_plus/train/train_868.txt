I'll be ready to go home now, so how do you like working at night? M: It's fine. After 3 months without a job, any work is OK with me. F: I know what you mean. You must be glad to have a job again. M: You'd better believe it. How long have you worked here? F: Not very long. I was hired right before Christmas last year. The job is not difficult, but I'd like to find something better. It's hard to make ends meet on this salary. M: I know. I've got 2 kids and I'm in debt. Luckily, my wife works, too. The bad thing is, she leaves for work right after I get home. F: Oh, that reminds me. My husband asked me to get some bread at the store. I'd better go now. They close at midnight.", "id": "train_868"}
