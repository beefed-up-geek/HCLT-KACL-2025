I could tell the boss you've gone to buy some office supplies if she asks. M: Thanks, I owe you one. F: Hey, not so fast, Mister. I need to know where you're going. Why do you need to be gone for that long? M: I forgot to get my dad something for Father's Day. F: Oh, man! You forgot your own dad's birthday? M: No, it's not his birthday. It's Father's Day! F: Since you're going, would you mind picking up something for my dad too? M: Oh, well, I guess I don't really know your dad though. Do I?
