I think everyone should have a laptop now because it's so useful. I can watch movies, download music from the Internet and most important, I can write reports on my students on my laptop. It's just amazing what you can do today. F: Any other products you especially like? An MP4 player or an iPad? M: No, I suppose I would have to say my digital camera.
