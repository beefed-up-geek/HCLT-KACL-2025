F: We offered them 3 choices, the end of March, the middle of April and the beginning of May. And they chose the earliest one, which is good actually with the exams coming up in May. M: Right. And how many are coming? Did you say about 12? F: Yes, they said 12 at first, but changed to 10 this morning. M: Good. We have 8 weeks to prepare. Here are my suggestions. On the first day, a welcome party. Then they can visit the schools in the district on the second and third days. F: We've got to remember this group wants to look at how computers are being used in the classroom. M: Exactly. So I want to ask Mr. Goodman to give them a talk on this on the afternoon of the third day. F: That'll fit in very nicely. M: And on their last day, they want to do some sightseeing. We could take them on a tour of London. But many of them may have been there already. And Schottland will be too far away. F: Why not take them for a walk along the coast? It should be interesting. M: Good idea, Cathy. I'm sure they'll like it.", "id": "train_3337"}
