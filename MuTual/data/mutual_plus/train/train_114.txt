This is the China Telephone Company. What can I do for you? F: Is this the Complaints Department? M: Yes, it is. F: I want to complain about the bill I received this month. I don't think I've made that many phone calls. Have their rates gone up? There must be a mistake in your billing. M: Alright Madam, tell me your phone number and I'll check it for you. F: My number is 63513516. M: Thank you. Please hold on for a moment. F: Alright. M: Hello? F: Yes, I'm still here. M: Well, there doesn't seem to be any problems with your account. The billing is accurate. You must have overlooked the international call you made to Europe. F: Let me see. Right. I'm sorry, it's my mistake. But it is still very expensive. M: Well, why don't you apply for the international dial service? It's free of charge. F: Can I do that? M: Sure. You can. The rates are cheaper as you do without assistance from the operator. F: I see. Well, thank you very much and I'm sorry for bothering you. M: It's no bother at all. That's what we're here for. Thanks for calling.", "id": "train_114"}
