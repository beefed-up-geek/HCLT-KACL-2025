I'll choose the shortest book because the book has won many awards."], "article": "M: Excuse me, I am writing an essay about ancient Greece. Are there any books on this topic that you can recommend? F: Geese? You want to write about ancient geese? I've never heard of such a thing. Anyway, it would be with a book of some animals, that's row J. Or you want to try science, that's in Row G. M: Animals? But Greece is a country, not an animal. F: Oh, Greece. Well, you know, today must be your lucky day. We have just received a new collection of books on that very topic. There are writers over here in row C. M: I see. That's a lot of books, which do you suggest? F: Well, the one by Robin Smith is excellent but it is very long. It's the one with the statue on the cover. There is also one by Milton Pike. It has a painting of a soldier on the front. As you can see, it's not very thick, so it shouldn't take too much time to read. But probably the best book is the one with the picture of ancient Olympic Stadium. It has won several history works rewards. M: Well, it's hard to decide, but I'm afraid I don't have enough time for a lot of reading. I think I'll get the book by Milton Pike. F: OK. Could I have your library card please?", "id": "train_3229"}
