F: I see. Well, it might be hard for you to get an A. So far, you have a B average. You would need a 97 or 98 on your final exam to get an A. Do you think you can get that higher score? M: Probably not. The problem is that I have to have a B average in all the subjects to get the prize from our government. Otherwise, I'll have to find a part time job. I'm afraid it is difficult for me to put all my heart in my study if I have to work in my spare time. I'll probably get an A in history and a B in maths, but I'll get a C in chemistry.", "id": "train_3891"}
