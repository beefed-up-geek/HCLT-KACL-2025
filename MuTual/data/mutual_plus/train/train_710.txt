You are free to go bowling whenever you want.", "F: Excuse me, could you repeat the question?", "F: Sure. I know that you love playing badminton the best."], "article": "M: Oh, hello, I like the holiday that mentioned Whales, was it whale watching? F: Oh yes, it's very popular. M: How long does it last? F: 2 days. We take up to 15 people on this tour, though we usually run it with just 12 or 13. M: And when is the next tour going? F: Umm, there is one in 3 weeks time on April the eighteenth and then we don't have another one until June the second. M: Is there anything else included in the tour? F: Oh, there are a lot of things. If you don't want to do the whale watching cruise, your guide will take anyone who is interested. In a Bush walk through the National Park near the hotel. There is no extra charge for that or on a fishing trip, which is an extra $12 I think. There is also a reptile park in town, which costs more or less the same. M: Well, I think I prefer Wales to Snakes. F: Oh, the hotel has badminton courts, and table tennis tables. But I think you'll be interested in going bowling there. M: Bowling? That sounds good. That's my favorite, thanks for the information.", "id": "train_710"}
