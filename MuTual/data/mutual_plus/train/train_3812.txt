Well, a friend of mine is studying in the UK now and she is worried about returning to China after her studies. She's worried that there are no job opportunities for her here. Do you have any advice for her? F: Well, in the beginning I thought there were more opportunities for me abroad. However, when I started doing some research, I realized that there were just equal opportunities in China now. M: Do you think she will find a good job here? F: Yes, I think so. Employers especially big international companies like to hire people who have lived or studied abroad. M: That's great. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak to me.
