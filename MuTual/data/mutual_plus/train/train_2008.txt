It's the paper bag night of the Hunter written by RA Salvatore you bought on our web 10 days ago, which is on October thirteenth, right? M: Yes. F: Well, we might need you to take a photo of the missing part of this book and upload it to the customer service page of our website. And when the problem is confirmed, we will send you a new book in 2 days. M: OK. Then what should I do with the old book? Should I send it back to you or something? F: That won't be necessary, sir. You can keep it if you like. Is there anything more I can help you with?", "id": "train_2008"}
