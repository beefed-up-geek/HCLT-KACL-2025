I am reading an article on the societies of the Ice Age. M: The Ice Age. There weren't many societies then, just a bunch of cave people. F: That's what people used to think. But a new exhibit at the American Museum on Natural History shows that the Ice Age people were surprisingly advanced. M: Oh, really? In what way? F: Well, the Ice Age people created language, art and music as we know it. And they didn't live in caves. They built their own shelters. M: What did they build them with? The odd weather would have killed most of the trees, so they couldn't have used wood. F: In some of the warmer places, they did build houses out of wood. M: How did they stay warm? F: Well, it says that in the early Ice Age, they often faced their homes toward the south to use the sun for heat. M: That is pretty smart. Can I read that magazine article when you have finished? I am really interested in it.", "id": "train_3267"}
