We're trying to finish interviews today. We need a roommate by the first of next month. F: OK. So how many of you live here? M: There are 3 of us. Mary and Rob are both nursing students. I graduated last year and I'm working in a bank. F: Oh, good. I'm a student as well. M: You don't smoke, do you? Mary refuses to live with smokers. Our last roommate claimed that she never smoked, but sometimes she would and it upset Mary a lot. F: No, no, I'm a non smoker. M: OK, good. My main concern is that you are quiet. We study a lot around here. F: I'm quiet. I'm also very clean. M: Great. Rob is the cleanest one in the house, so he'll be thrilled to hear that. F: Do you guys ever cook dinner together? M: Robin, Mary do. They're both very healthy. They eat salads and exercise every day. I work a lot, so I buy cooked food at a restaurant, then carry it away to eat at home most nights. But sometimes they share their food with me. F: I love to cook and I always make a lot, so I'd be happy to share with you. M: Awesome! Well, You seem like you'd fit in well in the house. When Mary and Rob get home this afternoon, I'll tell them that I met with you and I think they would like you. After that, I'll give you a call. F: Thanks.", "id": "train_2027"}
