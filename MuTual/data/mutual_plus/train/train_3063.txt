F: No, it's not about me. It's about Bonzo. M: What happened? F: I was playing football with Bonzo in the garden, and the ball went over the garden into the road. When Bonzo was running after it, he got hit by a car. M: Oh, no! Didn't the drivers see Bonzo? F: Not really. Bonzo was running too fast. We took him to the pet hospital immediately. But there was nothing they could do. M: Oh, poor dog. I know how much he meant to you. F: I have had him since he was 2 months old. He was like one of my family. M: I know you are very sad, but you can't be alone like this anymore. Let's go out and do some shopping, which is your favorite.
