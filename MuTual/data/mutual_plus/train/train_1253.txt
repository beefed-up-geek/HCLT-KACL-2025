I've been calling numbers in the phone books and you're the only one that answered. M: Just a moment. Don't worry. Where are you now? F: I'm at my office. I work in the morning side area. M: Well, you're in luck. I have to pass your area on my way home. Now I should be finished here by 7:30, so what about around 7:45? Is that OK?", "id": "train_1253"}
