F: That's all very interesting. But I still don't understand why you look like that? M: Well, we celebrate Holly by throwing colored powder and colored water at each other. And we light big fires, too, to show thanks to the gods. F: Interesting. But aren't you afraid that you'll catch a cold and get ill? I mean, you're completely wet. M: Actually, the things we throw at each other helped to keep us healthy. F: What do you mean? M: Well, the colored powders we throw are made from traditional Indian medicines.

Next year, if you're interested, I'll bring you along. F: That would be great. I'll make sure I keep February second free. M: Actually, Holly isn't like Christmas. The date changes from year to year.
