M: Oh, I was wondering if you'd like to get together and do something, like watching a movie or taking a walk down by the lake. F: I'd love to, but I'm really going to be busy all day on Saturday. M: What do you have going on that day? F: First, my mom asked me to help clean the house in the morning and then I have a dentist appointment at 12:30. I can't miss that cause I've cancelled twice before. M: Well, what about after that? F: Well, I'm going to be running around all day. After the dentist appointment, I need to meet Julie at 2 o'clock to help her with her science project. That's due on Monday morning at school. M: OK, but are you free after that? F: Hardly. Then I have to pick up my brother from soccer practice at 4:30 and my mom asked me to cook dinner for the family at 5:30. I feel like a slave sometimes.
