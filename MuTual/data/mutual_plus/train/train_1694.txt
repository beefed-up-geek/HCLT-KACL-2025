The problem is, it's only got 2 bedrooms, but I expect two of you could share. F: Well, as long as it isn't me, I've got to have my own room because I'd be working at home m ost of the time. Any other information? M: Yes, it's got a very big and well equipped kitchen. And I know you like cooking so that's another point in its favor. But there is a small sitting room and not much furniture yet, so let me know quickly if you want it or it will be taken.", "id": "train_1694"}
