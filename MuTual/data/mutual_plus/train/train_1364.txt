I spoke to you the other day about renting Flat 3A. F: Oh, yes, hello, Simon. What can I do for you? M: Well, I just want to ask a few practical details. Firstly, you mentioned a storeroom. Where exactly is that? Is it next to 3A, on the third floor? F: Well, the apartment's on the third, yes, but the storeroom's a little way away, just past the second door to the right. Under the stairs, in fact. M: But it's on the same floor, isn't it? F: Yes, it is. M: Fine. Is there hot water in the apartment? F: Oh, yes, it runs off the central heating.
