I always forget my test and homework, due dates and I can never find the right notes I need. I heard that you're really organized. Do you think you could help me? M: Sure, I'd be happy to help. First of all, you need to get a planner, like this one. It's a small notebook in calendar where you can write down all the important dates you need to remember. Then you should create some sort of filing system to organize your notes. I use different colored files to keep the papers for my different classes. F: Wow, those are great ideas. Do you think I could take a look at your planner and files? Thank you so much, I'm definitely going to take this advice.", "id": "train_4002"}
