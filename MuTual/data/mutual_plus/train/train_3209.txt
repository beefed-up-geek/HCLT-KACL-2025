I do not quite follow what you are saying, would you mind repeating that?", "M: It is true that we should bring some clothes. And our clothes may get wet while we are rowing boats in the cave.", "M: Why should we bring some tools? It is just a long and narrow cave without stream. We can finish visiting is safely."], "article": "F: Ladies and gentlemen, we'll pay a visit to a cave tomorrow. M: What fun is it to visit the cave you mean? F: It's an uncommon cave. It's underground, wide and long and in the cave there's rocks of different shapes which looked like a lion, a tree, a bell or something else. M: What else can we do there besides seeing the rocks? F: There's a stream running through the cave. You can row boats there. M: How will we get there and will it take a long time? F: About 60 miles away from here. First, we get to the town nearest to the cave in a passenger car and then we take an about 15 minute walk. M: May I understand that the cave is in a place far from the town? F: Not really. Since the ground is not strong, it's impossible to build roads or railways. M: Are there any restaurants where we can stay for lunch and have a rest? F: There are some. They are mostly opened by the local people. So if you are not used to the local food, I'd suggest you take some food yourself. M: What else should we take? F: Oh, your question reminds me of one thing that I have to mention. Bring with you some clothes in case it is cold in the cave. Is everyone clear about that?", "id": "train_3209"}
