F: Why is that? I know he gave you a snow globe yesterday. Doesn't that seem like a strange gift? M: Well, I'll be honest, his gifts can be out of times, but they just make me laugh. F: I'm glad. But my family always give very practical gifts. M: Oh, like what? F: We give gift cards of our favorite stores or even just money. M: Emm, I guess those are useful. But they don't seem like very fun gifts to receive. F: That's ridiculous. Gift cards and cash are always fun to receive. M: Gift cards and cash are practical. But they're not very imaginative. F: So, I can use them to buy anything I want. I like that. M: But giving a gift like that is taking the easy way out. You're not taking the time to select a gift you know the person will enjoy. F: OK, but what if the giver is wrong? What if you don't like the gift? M: In that case, I'll just ask for the receipt and return it. Or I regift it. F: Ah, how awkward. M: Well, people understand. And I'm always grateful for any gift. F: Really? If someone buys you something random, then they probably won't really thinking of you. M: That's true. A good gift should be thoughtful. F: So what makes a snow globe from your uncle so special? M: Winter is our favorite season. We both love snow. F: How nice. I see your point now. But for my birthday, please don't try to guess what I might like. A simple gift card is fine.", "id": "train_2106"}
