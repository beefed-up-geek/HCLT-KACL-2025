You're a hero! Come on, tell me all the details. F: Well, I was watching the pool from my chair, like I always do. There was a group of kids taking diving lessons in the deep end. M: Go on. F: I guess one of the students hit their heads on the diving board, because I saw that someone was sinking to the bottom of the pool. M: So what did you do next? F: I jumped in the pool after their instructor jumped in and brought the kid back to the surface. It was a young girl, and she had swallowed a lot of water. M: Wow, did you give her mouth-to-mouth? F: Of course. Then I told one of the kids to call for an ambulance. M: Quick thinking. F: The girl coughed the water up almost immediately, and just like that, it was over. We cleaned the wound and bandaged it up, and the emergency services arrived 20 minutes later. M: How was she? F: She had no memory of the past 10 minutes. She wanted to go back in the pool. She didn't even know why her parents were crying.", "id": "train_4063"}
