F: I gotta see for my report. I am wondering what I have done wrong. You know I have put a lot of time and energy to the report. M: Well, Meg. I understand you have made much effort on their report. Maybe that's why you are 2 days late to hand in the report. The due date is September third. F: Yes, professor. I am sorry about that. M: And this report is about the success of the Starbucks Coffee. In your report you have mentioned the company's management, selection of stores and service, but I am surprised that you didn't mention anything about its coffee. It's a coffee shop, Meg! Isn't the taste of its coffee the most important thing to its success? F: Yeah, I guess I have made a mistake by leaving it out. M: And figures are important too. You also need to add an actual figure, such as the monthly sales. F: You are quite right, professor. M: And why not do more research?
