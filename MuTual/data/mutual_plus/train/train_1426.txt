It's a lovely room, but it's quite a bad size. I will rent this house to you.", "F: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t understand. Could you repeat a little louder, please?", "F: You are welcome. So, if you want to rent this house, I can sign a contract with you now because I am the house owner."], "article": "M: Well, it's a lovely room, it's quite a nice size, but I don't like green paint very much. Would it be alright if I painted the walls Brown? F: Yes that's fine. As long as you don't paint them a very dark color. One of my renters painted them black, a few years ago. That was terrable. M: Is there anything I should know? F: Well, I don't allow cats to go upstairs at all. M: Oh, not at all? F: No, absolutely not. I don't like animals and I don't allow people to smoke in bedrooms. M: I agree with that, I don't smoke. Can I use the kitchen if I want to cook something? F: Yes, but only before 7:00 o'clock in the evening. M: Ok, I see. F: And one more thing. If you don't mind. I don't want any big noisy parties. M: Oh right, well, it sounds fair. Thank you very much.", "id": "train_1426"}
