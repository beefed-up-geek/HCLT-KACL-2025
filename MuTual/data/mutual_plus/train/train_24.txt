Tell me, Alisha, was becoming a famous singer something you'd always wanted to do? F: Not really, no. I'd always enjoyed singing of course, but the idea of becoming a star never occured to me until I saw Katie Wyatt, who'd been in my class back in my secondary school days in a talent show. And my brother said I got a better voice than her. I suddenly knew it was something I at least had to try to do. M: And how did you feel when you first went on live TV, and you had that victory? F: Well, I didn't actually sing that well. I was annoyed with myself and I thought my family and friends were a bit disappointed, too. At one point I was convinced I'd lost, so afterwards I was just glad when the scores were announced and it became clear I hadn't. M: You did in fact become famous overnight. F: Yes, I realized that the next morning when the national press had all the news about me. M: I imagine they said a lot of nice things. F: Yes, though it was mostly about how I had the right look, how stylish my clothes were and that sort of thing, rather than how I'd actually performed or what they thought of my singing voice.", "id": "train_24"}
