But it all started to be more than imagination once I got to college. F: What do you mean? M: Well, when I was a freshman, I didn't know what I wanted to major in. So I took a health class that included an emergency first aid certificate. I figured it would be useful to know how to help someone an emergency if they needed it. F: Sounds good. M: Well, one night as I was walking back to my dorm. I saw a woman on the ground who had stopped breathing. I gave her mouth to mouth breathing and called 911. By the time the ambulance arrived, she had been able to breathe normally. In addition, she left the hospital the next evening. The doctor said that I had saved her life. F: Amazing! You were a hero. M: And that was the night that I decided to study medicine. F: Alright. We're going to take a quick commercial break. But don't touch your remote control.
