We can know its size from the amount of light it puts out and its color. Then the size tells us how long a star will live. Big stars live a short life, while small stars live much longer. F: I've always wondered if there is an end in space. Do you think scientists have found the answer? M: This is a difficult question. The truth is that we have no idea. We currently don't have a way of testing it. But some scientists will come up with a way in the future. I have faith in it. F: The last question is from our readers. Do you believe there is other life in different parts of the universe? M: There are so many planets in the universe. Life may exist on other planets, but will we ever find or research them?
