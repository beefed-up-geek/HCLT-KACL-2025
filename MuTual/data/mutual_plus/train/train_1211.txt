Though he must be quite young, he seems like an old person. He's so boring. M: That's too bad. How is your English teacher? F: She is great. In today's class, she gave us a lecture on how to be a good student. She told us not to push ourselves hard for exams, but to pay more attention to communicating than memorizing. M: Did she give you any homework? F: Not today, she wanted us to relax tonight instead of doing homework.", "id": "train_1211"}
