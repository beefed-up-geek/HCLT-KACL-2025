F: Yes, I went to New York to attend a summer course in English. M: How lucky you are! How long did you stay there? F: About 50 days. I went there on July the fifth and came back on August the twenty-fifth. M: Where did you live in New York? F: I lived with an American family, the Whites. They're very kind people. Shortly after I arrived, we became good friends. And living in their house, I could speak English with them everyday. M: How nice! Then, how about the course? F: The course was also very good. The teachers were very nice. They taught us to listen, read and write in English, but it was mostly speaking. I found that the American classes are different from our classes here. The students there have more freedom. You can sit anywhere you like in the classroom. You can ask the teacher questions at anytime during the class. And you are welcome to share your ideas with the class. I really like this kind of class.", "id": "train_3492"}
