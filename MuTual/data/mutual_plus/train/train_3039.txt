At 5:30 AM on a Saturday morning? F: Yes, then I had a shower and went out to catch a bus into town. Instead of 8 o'clock AM, it didn't come until 8:15 AM and it was raining hard. M: Oh, dear. What happened next? F: When I got to town, it was 9:15 AM. So first of all, I went to the library, but it was closed. So I waited until 10:00 AM for it to open. M: Why did you go to the library?
