The first question, how often do you get in touch with your friends? F: Hmm... My friends aren't in the same secondary school as me, and I dislike ringing people up. I don't call my friends, even once a week. M: That means seldom. Secondly, how many friends can you talk with when you are upset? F: Oh, I can't think of any. I usually talk with you or mom when I feel sad. M: Poor Susan, you can't rely on us all the time. The last question, your friend wants to talk with you. Where would you have the talk? F: Well, we can't talk in the classroom. Maybe I would talk to her in a shopping center. We can talk and shop at the same time.", "id": "train_1311"}
