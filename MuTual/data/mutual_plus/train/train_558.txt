F: They want a marketing manager. Isn't that the kind of thing you're looking for? M: Yes. Does it say what the job involves? F: The main thing seems to be that you'll be in charge of sales planning. M: Well, what sort of people are they looking for? I suppose they want me to have an NBA. F: There's nothing about that. But it does say that they're looking for someone who can speak foreign languages. Well, that's OK for you, because you've lived abroad and you can speak German, don't you? M: Yes, and Spanish, too. When do the applications have to be completed? F: The third of July is the closing date. So you have exactly a month to complete. Do you want me to email you the advert, so you can see it yourself?
