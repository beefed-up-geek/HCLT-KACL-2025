F: I've read an article about eye problems recently. It says that people usually blink less when they use computer, so they may always feel tired and dry after using computers. M: That is what I am doing. And I am suffering from dry eyes. F: It is so common for people who have eye problems. M: But what does it have to do with the computer? F: The article found that people blink 22 times a minute in average when relaxed, but just 7 times a minute while staring at things on a computer screen. M: Really? That's quite a difference. F: Yeah, so you need to blink your eyes and take a break from the computer. M: I wonder if I drops will make me feel better. F: That might help. But the best way is to take a break and rest your eyes. M: OK. Let's go have a cup of tea. I can finish this later tonight.", "id": "train_87"}
