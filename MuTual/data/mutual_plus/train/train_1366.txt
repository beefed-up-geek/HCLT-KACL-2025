Could you repeat that?", "F: Sure. But why do you find flat 3A dissatisfied? Because it doesn't have a garden?", "F: I am so glad that you are interested in flat 3A."], "article": "M: Hello this is Simon Marshall. I spoke to you the other day about renting Flat 3A. F: Oh, yes, hello, Simon. What can I do for you? M: Well, I just want to ask a few practical details. Firstly, you mentioned a storeroom. Where exactly is that? Is it next to 3A, on the third floor? F: Well, the apartment's on the third, yes, but the storeroom's a little way away, just past the second door to the right. Under the stairs, in fact. M: But it's on the same floor, isn't it? F: Yes, it is. M: Fine. Is there hot water in the apartment? F: Oh, yes, it runs off the central heating. It's at a fixed 60 degrees. It used to be set at 55, but last year we were asked to increase it, so we did. M: OK, now can you tell me a bit about the yard, and the garden? How big are they? F: Well, the yard is about 20 square meters. M: Oh, so there's room for my motorbike, then. Although it is not new, I like to keep it off the road at night. An the garden? F: That's much bigger. About 150 square meters. M: Great. OK. Thanks for your help. I'll be in touch again soon.", "id": "train_1366"}
