I can't get my attention to studying for the midterm exam. I guess I'll have to go to the library this afternoon. F: I don't blame you. This dormitory doesn't have air conditioning. I can't study, either. My roommate and I are thinking about moving out to the other dorm, or an apartment that has air conditioning. M: Oh, I thought about moving to.
