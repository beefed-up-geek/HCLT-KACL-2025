I should ask the way when I arrive at Rain Avenue.", "M: So I'll drive to Mass Hospital and ask again.", "M: Just a minute! I do not quite follow what you are saying, would you mind repeating that?"], "article": "M: Excuse me Madam, can you tell me how to get to Sun College? I'm walking. F: Well, I think the simplest way for you is to go up to main street over there, turn left on main street and keep going for about 20 minutes. When you get to water square, turn right, keep on past the mass hospital to the end of the road, and then take a left turn. You'll be on Rain Avenue. Walk 2 blocks until you see the farmers bank. Cross the street and almost immediately take a left turn, again. The entrance to Sun College is down a few yards on your right, can you remember all that? M: I guess I got a little lost in the middle. F: Well, perhaps the best thing for you is to find your way up to mass hospital and ask again.", "id": "train_1952"}
