I'm not sure I can walk anymore. F: Oh, come on, you're not so old. I want to go to Monkey Island. M: Great. Let's go. I love monkeys. That's why I started dating with you. F: You're very funny today. As for me, I've always loved elephants and bears. I like their smell. Maybe that's why I chose you. M: Hahaha, I wish we could get some iced coffee somewhere. F: Yes, then I could buy you a coffee. M: Thanks. Hey, look at that polar bear. F: Oh, terrible. I can't believe they have him out in the sun like this. Isn't it too hot? M: It's sad. Sometimes I think zoos should treat animals better than they do. F: Definitely. They should have him in the air conditioning. They should give him a nice pool to swim in. M: They should let him have an iced coffee, too. F: You're thinking about yourself again. M: Just like him, I'm too hot. Both he and I are sick of Southern California. F: Why not move to Alaska?
