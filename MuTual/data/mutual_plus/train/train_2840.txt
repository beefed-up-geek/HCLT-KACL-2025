You can borrow up to 10 books each time. M: Yes, I see. F: Opposite the service desk is the training room, which is used by library staff to give training to staff and students on how to use the computer systems. The entrance to that room is round the other side. M: Is the training room beside the quiet room? F: Yes, that's right, with that entrance round the front too.
