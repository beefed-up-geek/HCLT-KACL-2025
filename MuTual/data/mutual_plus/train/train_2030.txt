M: Why not? Are you scared of flying? F: No, it's not that. It's just that I've never been outside the United States. So I don't have a passport. M: Oh, is that all? You can get one. It's super easy. F: No, I tried to. I went to the passport office. Unfortunately, it'll take at least 6 weeks for the passport to arrive. And you guys are leaving in a month. M: I heard if you pay an extra fee, you can get the passport in 3 weeks instead of the usual 6. F: That's cutting it pretty close. What if there is a delay? M: Well, maybe it would be better to skip this trip. You can use your passport next year when we go to Italy. F: Really? I'd love to go to Italy, especially for the food. M: Yeah, the food is amazing, but Spanish food is also pretty tasty. I'm going to get some Spanish hams in the market there. I can pick some up for you. F: That would be great. Much better than a T-shirt or a drum.", "id": "train_2030"}
