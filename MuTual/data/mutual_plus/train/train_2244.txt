M: I didn't get to copy down all the terms you mentioned in today's lecture and I know they were important. F: Do you remember what parts of the lecture you had trouble with? M: Not really. F: Can I take a look at your note? M: Sure. F: Interesting. M: What? F: David, just by looking through your notes from today and from last week's classes, I can tell that you've been missing a lot of important information from my lectures. Your notes are rather incomplete. M: What's wrong? I thought I took good notes. F: Not exactly. I think your note taking skills need some improvement. M: No. F: What I suggest is that you copy down the key points that I put on the board at the start of each class. That way you can follow along and keep up with the main ideas of the lecture.", "id": "train_2244"}
