I'd like to give the bike back to my cousin."], "article": "F: Hi, there. Did you have any questions about our bikes? M: Yeah, do you work on bicycles in addition to selling them? F: Oh, yes. We can handle any repairs you may need. M: That's great, but what I need is not exactly a repair. My cousin gave me a road bike, but I'm not tall enough to ride it. Can you put smaller wheels on it? F: We could do that, but I wouldn't recommend it because you would have to use your legs more to go the same distance. You'd be better off buying a bike that's the right size for you. M: I was afraid you'd say that. You see my cousin's bike is a very expensive model. It's a really nice bike. F: Have you considered trading the bike in? We do buy and sell used bikes and I can give you a fair price for any trade in. M: Really? That would be great. How much can you give me for the bike? F: If it's in good shape probably at least 50% of its original value.", "id": "train_2557"}
