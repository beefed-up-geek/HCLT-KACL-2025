F: And how did Andrew do? Was he nervous? This was his first concert. M: He seemed very calm. F: Did he make any mistakes? M: Well, sure. F: Oh, no. Did everyone notice? M: I don't think so. They were little mistakes. Someone would need to know the song very well to notice. I heard the mistakes but I don't think anyone else did. He seemed so calm that no one thought anything was wrong. F: I'm so glad to hear that. He's been working hard for many years to get this good on the piano. His next concert will be better.", "id": "train_2585"}
