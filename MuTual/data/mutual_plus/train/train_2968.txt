F: What is it, Bill? M: Well, I was hoping you could give me a ride to the airport. F: Can't you take the subway? M: My flight is early in the morning on Sunday. I don't think the subway is open then. F: Well, I've got tons of homework to do before next Monday. You know, we have exams on Wednesday afternoon. What about calling a taxi? It shouldn't be too expensive on a day with so little traffic. M: You're right, but it's not money I'm worried about. It's the time of day.
