M;F: I make most of the big decisions with the exception of more personal ones, such as what the bride will wear or who will be invited. I also booked the venue and the photographer. M;F: So, do people ask you to organize their weddings to save money? M;F: Well, I reduce some of the costs. But they have to pay my fee, so it works out about the same. In most cases, they are simply too busy to do it without assistance. M;F: Tell me, what made you want to become a wedding planner? M;F: In my case, it was after I'd been doing some voluntary work for a non-profit organization. Others come into wedding planning through different routes, such as restaurant management or providing meals for open air events. M;F: So how could someone find work in this type of business? M;F: Well, some companies offer courses, or you can provide written references from past clients. But in my case, people were impressed by shot of beautiful weddings planned and run by me.", "id": "train_237"}
