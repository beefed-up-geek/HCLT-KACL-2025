I heard it's really stressful. F: It was. It lasted all day. When we started, we were in a group of 10 people or so. We each had prepared a 5 minute lesson. Then we had to discuss a problem in a group and reach a solution. And finally, we interviewed one on one. It was really a long day. M: Yeah, I can imagine. When do you hear back?
