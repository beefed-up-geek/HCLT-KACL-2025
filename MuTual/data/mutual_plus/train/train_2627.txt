M: Well, Paris wasn't at all, sunny, but it was better than London, a bit cloudy. F: Did you go up the Eiffel Tower? M: Yes. We both had a great time. F: Where did you go after Paris? M: To Sydney. We didn't get to the famous Bondi Beach as there were a lot of thunderstorms. We did some shopping there. F: I bet that was expensive. M: It wasn't as expensive as Tokyo. It was hot and sunny there, no rain at all for the whole 5 days we were there. F: And then you went to the USA, didn't you? M: Yes, to San Francisco, which is famous for its fog.
