F: No, I haven't. M: Oh, well, he supposed to give his performance in 10 minutes. All the kids are waiting for him to sing. F: Maybe he's out by the fish tank, giving away balloons and talking with the dolphin trainers. Did you check there? M: Yes, I did, but they said they hadn't seen him. If you see him, please tell him that he's needed on the small stage as soon as possible. F: OK. I'll send a radio message out to all of the security officers and have them look for him. I'm sure he's on his way right now. M: Great. Thank you so much for your help. Will I see you at the bar after work tonight? F: Yes, but a bit later. I want to get a haircut and change clothes first. M: Great. I'll buy you a drink if you can get Dan the Bear on stage on time.", "id": "train_3410"}
