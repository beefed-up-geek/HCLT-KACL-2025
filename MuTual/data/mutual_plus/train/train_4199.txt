F: Hi, Andrew. I'm OK I suppose, not too bad. M: How's your job going? F: Oh, that's not OK. I've moved to a new office and I just hated. The people are unfriendly. Actually, I'm looking for a new job. M: Oh, really? Me too. I'm just so bored with my job. I've been there for too long. F: So what kind of job are you looking for? M: Well, I don't know for sure. Maybe something in the travel industry. I'd love to work somewhere nice and warm. Spain is my first choice. F: I see. It would be lovely to go and live abroad, wouldn't it? Hey, maybe we should go there together to set up a travel business. M: The problem is I don't speak Spanish. It'll be difficult for me to start a business there. F: I don't speak Spanish, either. But it doesn't matter. We should give it a try. M: Well, one day maybe. Anyway, let's go for lunch. We haven't seen each other for quite some time.", "id": "train_4199"}
