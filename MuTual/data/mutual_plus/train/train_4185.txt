In that case, I shall take the underground to go to your gallery.", "F: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t catch that. Would you mind speaking more slowly?", "F: So you think it's better driving there since neither bus nor subway goes there."], "article": "M: Thank you for calling the Hillside Gallery. How can I help you? F: Hello. Is there a photography exhibition this weekend? M: Yes, there is. F: How much is the ticket? M: Tickets for the gallery are 10 pounds and half price for children, but this includes the painting exhibitions, too. If you only want to see the photography exhibition, it's 7 pounds per person, with half price for children, too. F: The gallery's on Flower Street, isn't it? M: No, we moved to a different building last year. Our present address is 25 Gardenia Road. It's opposite to the Town Square. F: Oh, I see. Does the number 25 bus go by it? M: Yes, but I suggest you not take a bus or drive here. You will be stuck in a traffic jam at weekends on this street. The underground is easy and fast.", "id": "train_4185"}
