M: I'm worried about my 15 year old niece Helen. F: What's worrying you. M: I've seen a big change in her. She used to be very outgoing and sociable, but now she is having problems with other children at school. Now, she is totally someone else. F: Really? M: Yes. Now, she is quiet and doesn't want to talk to anyone else. Her teacher said things are going backward in her study. F: Her parents must be very anxious about her. M: No, not really.
