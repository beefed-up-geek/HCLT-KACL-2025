But you new one is not comfortable at all.", "F: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t understand. Could you repeat a little louder, please?", "F: Why do you think your new car is worth the money but it isn't comfortable?"], "article": "F: Why did you sell the car? M: It gave me too much trouble. I was spending too much money on it. I was spending more money than it was worth. Unfortunately, of course, when you actually sell the car, you've already spent the money on it, so you lose both ways. F: Well, what was the trouble with your old car? M: The engine needed a lot of repairs and the wheels were giving trouble now and then. When I set off on a journey, it gave me a sort of feeling but I might not get to the other end. So I decided to change it. F: Is the new car good? M: Yes, it's newer, more comfortable and it hasn't given me any trouble at all. When I set off, I'm quite sure that I'll be able to get to the other end safely.", "id": "train_3644"}
