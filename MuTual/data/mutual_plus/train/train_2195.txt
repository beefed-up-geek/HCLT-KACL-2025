Now I'm talking to Nick Parker, the singer with the band, Crispy. Hello, Nick. Welcome to our show. M: Hello. F: Nick, I have one question. Your sister Mel is in the band, too. Isn't she? M: Yeah, we've been playing and singing together since we were young. Dad took us to hear the great bands playing live, Mel and I put on shows at school. But mom didn't want us to get too serious about our music. She thought we should concentrate on our study. However, we were still enthusiastic about our music. F: Then how was your band formed? M: 2 musicians from music schools saw us playing in a concert. They asked if we'd like to form a band with them. We agreed to try it out. F: How about the band in the first year? M: To our surprise, the audiences enjoyed our performance in the local concert. Then we recorded 2 songs and sent them to a music company. They asked us to join them, but our parents said we had to finish college first. F: Have you had any disappointments? M: Everything we've recorded has done well. 3 singles have gone to number one and our first album has sold over 1,000,000 copies. We've got thousands of fans. However, I've been ill recently, so we've started recording our second album late, which is a pity.", "id": "train_2195"}
