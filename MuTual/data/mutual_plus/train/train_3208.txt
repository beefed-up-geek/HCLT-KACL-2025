{"answers": "B", "options": ["M: But I will not know if I like the taste because you said there is no restaurant opened by local people.", "M: Just a minute! I do not quite follow what you are saying, would you mind repeating that?", "M: I agree. Foods there must be expensive even though there is a railway linking the cave to the town.", "M: Thank you for reminding me that it is very far from the town and we can buy food there conveniently."], "article": "F: Ladies and gentlemen, we'll pay a visit to a cave tomorrow. M: What fun is it to visit the cave you mean? F: It's an uncommon cave. It's underground, wide and long and in the cave there's rocks of different shapes which looked like a lion, a tree, a bell or something else. M: What else can we do there besides seeing the rocks? F: There's a stream running through the cave. You can row boats there. M: How will we get there and will it take a long time? F: About 60 miles away from here. First, we get to the town nearest to the cave in a passenger car and then we take an about 15 minute walk. M: May I understand that the cave is in a place far from the town? F: Not really. Since the ground is not strong, it's impossible to build roads or railways. M: Are there any restaurants where we can stay for lunch and have a rest? F: There are some. They are mostly opened by the local people. So if you are not used to the local food, I'd suggest you take some food yourself.", "id": "train_3208"}
