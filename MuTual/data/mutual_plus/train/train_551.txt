I'm at Kuala Lumpur Airport. M: Welcome to Malaysia. I sent my driver to pick you up, is he there? F: No, he isn't. M: I'm sorry about that. There's been a mix-up. F: You got my email about the change in the arrival time, didn't you? M: Yes, and I asked my workmate to tell my driver. But my driver got the wrong information and went to the airport this morning. F: Oh, no. M: When you didn't arrive, he came back. I told him to go out to the airport again. Maybe he's on his way now. F: OK, I'll wait for him. M: Right, shall we have dinner together this evening? I'll meet you at your hotel at about 8 o'clock if that's OK. F: That sounds good.
