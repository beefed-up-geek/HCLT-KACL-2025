F: Well, I read an article about a woman who'd lost her job, she used her savings to start her own business. That made me think. My friends often told me I was a good gardener and I thought, why not? M: How did you get started? F: Oh, doing small jobs for friends and relatives and I soon found myself getting plenty of work. But there was a lot of rain during that first year, so some jobs took longer than planned. But I got nice comments from people when the jobs were finished. M: And how are you getting on now? F: Very well, I get most of my new customers from people who have recommended me, and I haven't needed to look for work by knocking on doors. I do advertise, but that's just a few notices in shop windows.", "id": "train_1391"}
