It's very near the city center. At lunch, it's full of office workers, but I like to go before that, in the middle of the morning. I go there and order big breakfast and take one of their newspapers and just relax for an hour or so. Their pancakes are delicious. They don't have a TV in there, which I love most. They just have some jazz music, very quiet. Nothing too loud. What's your favorite restaurant?", "id": "train_1453"}
