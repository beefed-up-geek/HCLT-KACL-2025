M: Sure, Cindy. What's up? F: This food is tasty, but I'm not sure it's very healthy. M: Well, this was my first time to cook for you. I guess I was a little nervous. F: That's sweet. M: I put too much salt on the potatoes. F: Yeah. I like salty food, but that was a bit too much of a good thing. M: And I overcooked the steak. So I tried to cover it up by adding more butter. F: Well, it's not easy to cook a steak. My dad has been trying to teach me that forever, and I still never know how it's going to turn out. M: I know you've cooked a lot before. I suppose I just wanted to impress you by telling you that I love to cook, too. I don't know what I was thinking. F: It's the thought that matters. Maybe we could make something together next time.
