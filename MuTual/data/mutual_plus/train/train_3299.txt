I had a mid term exam for my literature course and I... I had to do some last minute revision for it. Yes, I will certainly be at the class today, though. Sorry, I missed the experiment yesterday. F: Hmm...I don't really think reviewing for an English literature exam is a very good excuse, do you? M: No, you're right. It isn't a good excuse at all. It's just that I did a very similar experiment in chemistry 101 last time, so I felt I probably wouldn't miss too much.", "id": "train_3299"}
