I'm just calling to let you know that I will be late for today's meeting. F: Oh, I see, that's not good. We have a meeting with clients. So you really should be on time. M: Yes, I know, it's just that my car was stolen and now I'm in the taxi. Right now the traffic's really bad as well, so really don't know when I'll be able to make it into the office. F: Um, well, thanks for calling. I'll inform Mr. Darren that you'll be late. I don't think he will be too angry. M: That's a relief. I know we have this important meeting and that I should be there. F: Oh, one moment, please. I have just been informed that the clients are also running late. They said there're stuck in traffic, too. It looks like everything will be OK.", "id": "train_511"}
