Getting abler children to be perfect is really something that you love and enjoy in the middle school."], "article": "M: I have with me this evening, Louise Graham, a group leader at Ravens Field Outdoor Adventure Center for children. Louise, how long have you been there? F: Well, before I first went there 2 years ago, I thought I'd probably only stay for a year. But after 6 months or so. I really started to enjoy the job, so I'd been there ever since. To be honest, I was lacking in self confidence and when I first arrived I was a bit worried about making mistakes. I was frightened I might put the children in danger because of my inexperience. M: What's the best thing about your work? F: One thing I like is seeing them have so much fun. Even if sometimes their behavior isn't perfect, and I can suggest activities that haven't been tried before, but there are always some children who haven't quite got as much ability as others, and for me, the most rewarding part of the job is getting them to succeed and things they haven't managed to do before. It's hard work though, sometimes you're on duty at night.", "id": "train_362"}
