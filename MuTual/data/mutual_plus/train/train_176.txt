M: Do you feel the same way as you did 6 years ago? F: Well, not really. I used to be more enthusiastic. Maybe it's because I'm older now. M: Well. You're only 28. That's not exactly old. What else has changed? F: I work longer hours now. I go home after 7 nearly every day, but I earn much more than before. M: I see. What about the company? Is it helping you to develop new skills?
