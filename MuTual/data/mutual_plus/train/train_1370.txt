Have you been to the doctor's? M: No, I'm not ill. I'm just a bit tired. I'm probably not sleeping enough. F: You shouldn't go out so late then. M: I'm not going out at all, actually. I'm too busy studying. F: Studying? But the exams aren't for another 2 months yet. M: I know, but I've got a lot to do. I didn't do much last term. I wish I'd been more like you. F: Well, yeah. I went to every lecture and I took lots of notes, but that doesn't mean I'll get good grades. At least you don't get nervous in exams like I do. M: Have you started revising yet? F: Not yet. I'll probably start next week. But I'm not going to stay up all night doing it. That never does any good. I might work until midnight a couple of times, but that's all. Anyway, you should have a week off. M: I don't think so. I can't afford the time.", "id": "train_1370"}
