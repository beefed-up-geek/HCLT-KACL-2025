I am looking for a pair of trousers for my son. Could I see that pair hanging in the window? F: Sure sir. Is this the pair you meant? M: Yes, that's it. What are these trousers made of? My son's skin is quite sensitive, so I have to be careful about the material of the clothes he wears. F: These are made of cotton, sir. These are made by a famous children's brand called Wonder World. It's a very popular brand because of the good quality material. M: Oh, that's good. What other colors do these trousers come in?
