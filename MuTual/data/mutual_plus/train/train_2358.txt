M: Uh, what? F: The movie is over. You slept through the best part. M: Ah, I must have fallen asleep during the last few minutes. F: You did. He were out for so long. You should've brought your pillow and blanket. So what did you think about it? M: Well, overall, I'm a little disappointed with the movie. The story was not believable. You have to admit.
