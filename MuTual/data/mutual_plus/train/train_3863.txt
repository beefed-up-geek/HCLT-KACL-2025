How are you? M: Oh, hi, Rebecca. I'm tired. F: Well, don't go to bed so late. M: But I don't. I watch sports on TV and then I go to bed at about 9:15. The problem is I wake up really early. F: Why is that? M: I take the boat to school now and it goes at 7:30 in the morning so my mom wakes me up at 6:44. I have breakfast and leave home at 7:00. F: So have you changed school then? M: Yes. The school on our island is for 6:00 to 11 year olds. Now I'm 12. F: Oh, I see. So do you get home late in the evening? M: Quite late. The boat back home is 2 hours after school. My mom's sister lives near the school. So I go and have dinner at her house. F: When do you have time to do your homework? M: I usually find a quiet table on the boat. When I get home, I watch TV, listen to music or use the computer.", "id": "train_3863"}
