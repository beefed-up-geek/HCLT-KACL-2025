F: I bought this new radio here half a month ago, then I posted it to my daughter who is studying English in Shanghai Foreign Language University. But a week later she posted it back, saying that it doesn't work. I don't know why. Could you help me check out the radio? M: Let me see. Did you check it when you bought it? F: Of course. I remember I could receive shortwave programs very well. M: Let me check it. It seems as if it's not our fault. The radio seems to have been left in the rain. You should go to the post office and explain everything to them. F: It sounds reasonable, but I'd like to have my radio repaired here. I think you are for the best service. M: Thank you, madam. You can leave it to me. F: That's very kind of you.", "id": "train_2229"}
