For example, many 8 year-old boys can do much more than he can. But of course, he has a special gift. F: In drawing? M: Yes. He's always been good at it. Steven can look at any building for about 5 minutes and then draw it perfectly. F: Tell us something about some of the drawings he's done.", "id": "train_3272"}
