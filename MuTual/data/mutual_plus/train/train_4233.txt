Thanks for introducing how to have the right equipment.", "M: Thank you for your advice. I believe those who plan on climbing will wear enough clothes."], "article": "M: Welcome back to your student union radio station. I'm with Catherine, who just successfully climbed the Great Mountain, Mont Blanc. Actually, she once did. The same climb in 2007. Catherine, was it easier the second time around? F: In many ways. They were totally different experiences. The first time I went as part of an organized group. We took 4 days to reach the top. This year, I decided to go alone with just one overnight stop, actually you're never really alone. It's all been crowded up there. The first climb, was quite difficult is the weather was very changeable, and we found ourselves climbing in very cold windy conditions. The weather this time was wonderful. Plus. I spent a few days before in chamonix and got myself more used to the height. If it's certainly made it easier, you can also achieve the same thing by climbing some of the smaller mountains first. M: Well, I'm wondering if you have any useful advice for others? Planning on doing something similar. F: Well, I'm not talking here about the physical condition you need to be in, or having the right equipment. That goes without saying, we should pay special attention to the extreme weather conditions. You really need to wear enough clothes to protect yourself from the cold and wind.", "id": "train_4233"}
