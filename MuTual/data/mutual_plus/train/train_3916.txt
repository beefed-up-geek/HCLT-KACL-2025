It doesn't really matter. M: But I must say sorry to you. I didn't mean to break my word. I was about to leave home when my mother suddenly passed out. I took her to the hospital and looked after her all night. It was not until this morning that I remembered my date with you. F: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Is she OK now? M: She's alright, but I'm terribly sorry to have kept you waiting last night. F: I quite understand it's not your fault, but don't forget to call me up next time if you can't come.", "id": "train_3916"}
