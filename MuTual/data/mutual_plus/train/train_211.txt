I've applied for several jobs, and already got some offers. M: Good for you, Mary. You are always about the most hard-working student in our class and your efforts finally paid off. F: It's so nice of you to say so, Lucas. And how about you? M: I have to do some more studies to become a lawyer. F: Oh, being a lawyer is not easy nowadays. And you have to overcome a lot of difficulties to achieve your ambition. M: Definitely. But if our ambitions were so easy to achieve, we would soon get bored. F: That's sure. But there's another story. Some people were working really hard yet not succeed. M: That is why ambition needs to be realistic. You can't (?) too high. F: Sounds reasonable. But according to my understanding, a careful plan in advance places the most important role in achieving success. M: You're right. In addition, interest is the best teacher.

But I'm not interested in any hospital jobs. M: A good doctor should be mentally physically strong. F: Definitely.
