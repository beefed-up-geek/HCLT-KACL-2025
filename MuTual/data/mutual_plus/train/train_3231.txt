M: But Miss James, Michael hasn't arrived yet. Can we just wait for him just a little longer? F: I'm sorry, Bil. I think we just can't. We'll be very late getting to the art gallery. M: I know Miss, but Michael was really looking forward to seeing those paintings. F: Yes, I know. I didn't realize he had a strong interest in that. M: Yes, he is. He paints and draws all the time. Last week he painted a picture of you. F: Of me? How wonderful. I really would love to see it. M: Well, you can see it anytime you like. He painted on the wall in the park near our school. You walk past there every day. You must have seen it. F: What? You mean that painting of a camel with a person's head? Is that supposed to be me? M: Yes, Miss.
