You just need to go off work one hour earlier to take the course.", "M: I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t understand. Could you say it again?"], "article": "F: I can't decide which classes to take. I don't like any of the ones I've signed up for and two of the ones I really have to take are at the same time. M: Pass me the course schedule book. Which classes are at the same time? F: Biology 201 and introduction to chemistry. The both required classes. M: Let's find out if either of them is offered next semester. Look here, the chemistry classes. You can just take it in the spring. F: Yes, that's true and the biology class is in a series so I need to take 201 this semester. The only problem with taking chemistry next semester is that it meets every day at 8:00 AM. M: What's wrong with that? Is that too early for you? F: Not too early, but I was trying not to take classes on Fridays. I want to work in the lab that whole day. I might be able to work for one of my professors. M: Maybe you can start work after the class is over. It's only an hour lecture. I'm sure the professor will understand. F: I hope so.", "id": "train_1893"}
