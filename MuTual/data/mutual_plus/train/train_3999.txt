The last step in the laundry process is folding the clothes. I should be sure to leave the machines going if I am not at home."], "article": "F: OK, boys. It's time that you learn how to do your own laundry. Who can tell me the first thing that you need to do? M: Separate the whites from the dark colours. F: Good job, Matt. Now, what do you do after you put the clothes in the washer? M: Choose the speed, size of the load and water temperature that you want. F: Excellent, Matt. You're almost ready to do this yourself. You just forgot one thing, put in the soap, before you start the machine. Then press the start button and wait until the washer makes the short high sound. That means the cycle is complete, then what do we do? M: Clean out the dryer and then put the clothes in it, choose the temperature level and timing and press start. F: Good job, Matt. You sound like you're ready to go. Be sure never to leave the machines going if you're not at home and make sure to take out the clothes and fold them as soon as their dry, so they don't wrinkle. Now you can do this all by yourselves!", "id": "train_3999"}
