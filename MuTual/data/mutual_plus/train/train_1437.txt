{"answers": "D", "options": ["F: OK. You believe Mr. Carbon has made a box office success and people are becoming less aware of the climate change.", "F: Just a minute! I do not quite follow what you are saying, would you mind repeating that?", "F: Okay, I see. You said Mr. Carbon has played a role in a disaster movie but gives no cause for concern.", "F: Well, in your opinion, Mr. Carbon has aroused people's concern about climate change."], "article": "F: Why did you decide to publicize climate change in this way? M: Well, I was really upset about some countries failure to sign up pollution control agreements. It felt like the science wasn't getting understood by the politicians, so I decided to look into what I personally could do, that led me to dream up a cartoon character called Mr Carbon. We all know somebody like him, he's climate ignorant and makes no effort to save energy. Of course, factories are the obvious bad character in the real world, but I couldn't do much about them. F: So, are we going to see him in scenes like we get in disaster movies? M: That's pretty unlikely, it's hard to make a box office success. But he certainly gives cause for concern. People are becoming more aware of the climate change.", "id": "train_1437"}
