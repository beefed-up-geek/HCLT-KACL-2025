I do not quite follow what you are saying, would you mind repeating that?"], "article": "F: Thanks for coming in today. Please have a seat. Tell me a little bit about yourself. Why do you think you are qualified for this job? M: I've worked as a music teacher my whole life, mainly with children. And now I'm ready for a change, because I love music so much. I think working at a radio station would be perfect for me. F: The duties of this job include answering the phones and sending emails. How are you with both of those things? M: I'm experienced in sending emails and I'm also fairly confident on the phone. When I was a teenager, I worked at a TV station answering phone calls. So this is probably pretty similar. F: We also have some early mornings here in the studio. Sometimes you'll have to be here around 4:00 or 5:00 AM? How do you feel about that? M: I'm an early riser, so that's easy for me. It also means less traffic, which I'm always a fan of. F: Do you have references I can call? M: Yes, I have a list to give you. Two are people I worked with at my last job, and one is an old graduate school professor of mine. F: Great! Well, I think that's it. I'll give you a call back in the next few days to let you know our decision. M: Thank you so much.", "id": "train_904"}
