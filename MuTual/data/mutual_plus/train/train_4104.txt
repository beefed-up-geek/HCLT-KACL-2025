I made some sandwiches earlier and left them on the table when I went to answer the phone. But someone must have taken them, because they're gone. M: Oh, it must have been dad. I'm sure he was in the kitchen earlier. F: No, he went off to his tennis match before I finished making them, so he couldn't have done it. Anyway, he couldn't carry a plate of sandwiches as well as his tennis stuff, so I'm sure it wasn't him. M: Well, it wasn't me. But look, are these your sandwiches here, on the bottom shelf of the fridge? F: Are they there? Oh, my goodness, I must have put them there when the phone rang. Oh dear, I really must be losing my mind. M: Well, you needn't go to the shop now. Let's have lunch.", "id": "train_4104"}
