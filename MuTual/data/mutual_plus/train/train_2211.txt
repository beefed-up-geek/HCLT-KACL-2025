OK, so I have a few questions. First, when did you know you wanted to write children's books? F: Well, I studied creative writing in college, but after I graduated I worked in advertising. It wasn't until I had my own children that I got interested in children's books. M: Did you write one for your kids? F: Yes, I did. My best friend drew the pictures for me. M: And did they like it? F: They loved it. A friend of my husband saw a copy in our home and he showed it to a publisher that he knew. They published it that year. The next year, I wrote 3 more books. Since the beginning, I have had a total of 8 published.", "id": "train_2211"}
