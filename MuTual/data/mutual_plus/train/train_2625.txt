First we went to London but only for a few days as it rained all the time. Both of us got really wet. F: You went to Paris next, didn't you? M: Well, Paris wasn't at all, sunny, but it was better than London, a bit cloudy. F: Did you go up the Eiffel Tower? M: Yes. We both had a great time. F: Where did you go after Paris? M: To Sydney. We didn't get to the famous Bondi Beach as there were a lot of thunderstorms. We did some shopping there. F: I bet that was expensive. M: It wasn't as expensive as Tokyo. It was hot and sunny there, no rain at all for the whole 5 days we were there. F: And then you went to the USA, didn't you? M: Yes, to San Francisco, which is famous for its fog. It was so thick that we didn't go to see the Golden Gate Bridge. But it was warmer than some of the other places.", "id": "train_2625"}
