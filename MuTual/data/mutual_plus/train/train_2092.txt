M: Wow, that was fast. I hardly told anyone. The boss just told me a few hours ago. Lily, Katie doesn't know yet in fact. F: Really? So why wait? When are you going to give her the big news?

F: Well, I lived there in two thousand and ten. It's not that different from the US. The weather is the same and the local people have similar customs, but the food is much better in France. What about your family? Are they all moving with you? M: I hope to move everyone in a few months. I definitely don't like the idea of spending my year without Katie and our kids.", "id": "train_2092"}
