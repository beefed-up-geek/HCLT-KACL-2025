Tell me, Alisha, was becoming a famous singer something you'd always wanted to do? F: Not really, no. I'd always enjoyed singing of course, but the idea of becoming a star never occured to me until I saw Katie Wyatt, who'd been in my class back in my secondary school days in a talent show. And my brother said I got a better voice than her. I suddenly knew it was something I at least had to try to do. M: And how did you feel when you first went on live TV, and you had that victory? F: Well, I didn't actually sing that well. I was annoyed with myself and I thought my family and friends were a bit disappointed, too. At one point I was convinced I'd lost, so afterwards I was just glad when the scores were announced and it became clear I hadn't. M: You did in fact become famous overnight. F: Yes, I realized that the next morning when the national press had all the news about me. M: I imagine they said a lot of nice things. F: Yes, though it was mostly about how I had the right look, how stylish my clothes were and that sort of thing, rather than how I'd actually performed or what they thought of my singing voice. M: How do you feel about friendships among famous people? F: I wouldn't say that exactly. Just remember it's probably going to end sometime, and when it does you'll want to go back to those you were close to before you were famous, so don't lose touch with them. M: Thank you, Alisha.", "id": "train_25"}
