F: No, I'm not. M: Where? I can certainly help you if you'd like some advice. This skirt and scarves over here are back in style. F: Oh, I'm here to look for a winter coat. M: How about this one? It's made of very high-quality wool. F: It's nice but actually I need something warmer. This would work if I were staying here in Los Angeles. But it's too light for Chicago winter. M: Ah, you need a very heavy coat. Then please follow me. This one here is a good value and is one of our warmest coats. It's also quite fashionable and very comfortable.
