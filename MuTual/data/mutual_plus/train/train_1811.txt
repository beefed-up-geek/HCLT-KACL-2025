Our entire book collection is on our website. You can look up the books you need, then I'll walk you over to their location in the main building. M: Thank you, but I'm not sure which books to look up on the computer. My topic is very general. How can I search for a few books on a topic instead of one specific book? F: I'll show you. Type your topic into the search box on the screen and a list of books will come up. Then pick the few books that you want and will look for them on the bookshelves. M: Thank you. F: Remember, you can only check out up to three books at a time.", "id": "train_1811"}
