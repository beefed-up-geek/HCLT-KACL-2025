I went to see a special James Bond exhibition at the Science Museum. M: Sounds interesting. Though aren't museums a bit expensive? By paid $8 last time I went. F: This was only 650. I did buy a guidebook as well. That was an extra 295. M: How did you get there? F: You can take the underground but I went by bus. It stops just outside, I got very tired walking around the museum, though. M: What did you see? F: James Bond's plane, which was my favorite, and the tiny Camera and his car, things like that. M: These sounds great. How early can you go in, at 9:00? F: Not until 10 and we didn't get there until 11:30, so there wasn't enough time to see everything. M: Can you eat there? F: Yes. You can even take a picnic. I had a sandwich at the cafe. But you can get a hot meal at the restaurant. M: I'd really like to go. On free next Saturday, that's the twenty-thirdth of April. F: The exhibitions on until the twenty-seventh, so the Saturday may be busy.", "id": "train_680"}
