Why don't you like it?", "M: I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t understand. Could you say it again?", "M: Yes. Your silver jacket is very unique. I bet that's the reason you love it."], "article": "M: Veronique, when you are not studying, what do you like to do? F: I like listening to music by French singers. Go into any French music store and you'll find the Top 10 albums by US, German and English artists. It's good to have variety, but I love French music. M: Do French teens like fast food, you know, hamburgers, chips and things like those? F: Well, we don't really like that. We usually have quick breakfast, sandwiches at lunch and a family dinner at around 8:00 to 8:30 in the evening. The younger teenagers like to eat hamburgers at McDonald's. M: Paris is well known for popular clothes, so I'm sure it offers French teens the most up-to-date clothes to choose from. F: Exactly. I like to wear clothes by Agnes B, a popular French designer. I think Agnes B clothes are kind of classic, but they can also be very lovely. One of my favorites is a silver jacket, because it came from one of the shows and most importantly, there is no other like it.", "id": "train_3573"}
