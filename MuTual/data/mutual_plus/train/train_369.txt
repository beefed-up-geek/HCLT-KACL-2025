M: Well, I was riding on my bicycle along the street, when a taxi driver suddenly made a sharp turn in front of me. I could not stop my bicycle in time and I was knocked down. Fortunately, I only got a broken arm and a broken leg. The doctor said that I would have to stay in hospital for at least a week. F: Do your arm and leg hurt now? M: Yes, my leg hurts badly, but I can bear the pain. The only thing that I'm worried about is my classes, you know? Our teacher said next week, we would have our midterm exams. F: Well, don't worry about the exams. I can help you. M: Thank you. But I don't really want to stay here that long. Anyway, thank you for coming to see me.", "id": "train_369"}
