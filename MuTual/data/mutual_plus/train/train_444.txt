F: A young girl and her grandfather in Switzerland. It takes place in the late eighteen hundreds. M: That's not a new movie. Now I remember I saw that when I was little. F: It's a remake. It's much more realistic than the first one filmed in one thousand nine hundred and thirty-seven with Shirley Temple, although that one has become a classic. Another one was made in one thousand nine hundred and fifty-two and again in two thousand and five. The movie is actually based on a book, and the director of the current movie stayed really true to the story. The little girl who plays Heidi was chosen from over 500 actresses. Isn't that amazing? She's really talented! M: I'd love to see it. I really enjoyed that movie as a child. F: It's the first film in a three part series. I'm excited to see the next 2 when they come out.", "id": "train_444"}
