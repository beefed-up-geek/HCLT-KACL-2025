I made it just for this party. F: Sorry, Bill, I'm not in the cake at the moment. I thought you knew about my diet. M: On your birthday? Surely you can eat whatever you want on your birthday. You can start your diet tomorrow. And anyway, you look great. F: Well, thanks, Bill. I am not on a diet to lose weight, actually. My doctor told me to stop eating certain foods. I'm trying to avoid being allergic to something. M: I didn't know food could help with that. I also notice you didn't eat any of the sandwiches Jill brought. F: Yeah, and you and Tom and Shellin all brought different cakes. I'm dying to try them. M: Why don't I go get you a salad? I'm sure you'll feel better if you eat something. F: All right, it's the only thing here I can eat. What I really want is some hot soup. M: Why don't I go and get some soup from the restaurant across the street for you? F: That's awfully nice of you. But I'm enjoying my party. Maybe we could go afterwards. M: OK, you go back in the house and chat with the guests. And I'll call the restaurant and tell them we'll be there in a few hours.", "id": "train_2446"}
