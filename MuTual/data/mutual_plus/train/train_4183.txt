F: That's alright, Joe. My house isn't that easy to find. But you know, you wouldn't have gotten lost if you had a smart car. M: A smart car? What's that? F: I just read a magazine article about some new technology that can make a car smart, that something like a GPS with a map display and a voice. You just enter the address where you want to go and the voice tells you how to get there street by street. M: Hey. That's just like my brother. He never gets lost and he's always telling me the best route. So what else will smart cars be able to do? F: Well. The article said that they'll be equipped with warning systems that will warn drivers if they're getting too close to other cars with an alarm signal. And they'll even put on the brakes if the drivers don't. M: It seemed to be reported on TV, too. Tell me, Cindy, will these cars be smart enough to fill themselves up with gas? F: Not that I know of. Why do you ask? M: Well, I'm not late, because I got lost. I am late because I ran out of gas on the way over here.", "id": "train_4183"}
