The main attractions on the red route are the White House, the Lincoln Memorial and the Smithsonian Museum. M: How do I book the tickets? F: Well, you could do that by phone with one of our operators, or you can book through our website. Of course, you could just show up and buy a ticket the day you want to take the tour. M: Alright. I'll just book it online once I know our travel dates. F: OK, well, just remember that it can get very busy over the three months from June to August. So it's probably best to book at least a week before you come, but you still have about 6 weeks. So you have plenty of time to think about it.", "id": "train_4227"}
