Please repeat it."], "article": "F: My mom thinks that we should name the baby after her. What do you think? M: I think your mom is a little too selfish. Plus, I don't really think Betty Betson sounds like a name I'd want to have. F: OK, I just had to ask. I didn't like the idea much either. I really love the name Laura, though. M: That's nice but I think we should give her a really strong name so she stuff. How about Helga or Josephine? F: Those names make me think of unattractive women. Elga sounds like a lady who could carry me under her arm. M: That's the idea. I don't want anyone thinking they can mess with my daughter. I want her to be able to stand up to people, especially any boys who might try to look at her. F: I don't think a name has that much power, dear. M: OK, I see your point. I'll just have to take care of the boys myself. I know this baby is going to be beautiful. F: That's right. Let's not give her an ugly name. How about something more elegant like Victoria? M: I like that.", "id": "train_2623"}
