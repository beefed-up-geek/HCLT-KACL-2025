F: Yeah, I see that, but what are you doing with them? M: We're flying them, of course. F: Out of the window? M: Yeah. F: That isn't right. You shouldn't throw paper out of the window near the land on the street and someone will have to pick it up. You're just making the street dirtier than it already is. M: No, we aren't. First of all, we're not throwing the airplanes out. We're making them fly. And second, most of our planes aren't going on the street. F: Where are they going?
