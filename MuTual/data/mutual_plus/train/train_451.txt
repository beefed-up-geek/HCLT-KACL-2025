But they don't have many kinds of sauces in jars, do they?", "F: I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t understand. Could you say it again?", "F: There are few foreign products. I hear about that they don't have any import items."], "article": "M: Have you been to the new Chinese market? F: No, I only shop at small local stores. That place looks huge. M: You should really go. It has everything you could need to make your Vietnamese food too. They have imported items from several countries. The vegetables are pretty fresh and the meat is of good quality. F: But how are the prices? M: There are great deals, especially for dried foods. I bought a 10-pound-bag of rice for $5, and I found 2 pounds of special noodles for a dollar. There are hundreds of sauces in jars. I even found a Thai sauce there that I couldn't find anywhere else. I think you'll be very happy with what you find at this market.", "id": "train_451"}
