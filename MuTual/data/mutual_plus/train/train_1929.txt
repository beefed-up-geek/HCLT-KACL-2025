M: Well, that's a nice idea, Cindy. But what would you study? F: I'm not sure. I've always been interested in psychology. I think I'd do really well. M: Uh-huh, it's not that I don't believe in you, sweetheart. You were always a good student, but it's different when you're an adult going back to school. F: Well, I don't think I would have any problems making friends. Lots of older folks get a second BA degree later in life, just like I would be doing and besides I've always been young at heart.

M: Yeah, but that's not what I'm worried about honey. Have you given any thought to what you do when you graduate? F: I suppose I'd look for a job.
