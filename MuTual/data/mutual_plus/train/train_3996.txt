{"answers": "C", "options": ["F: It's boring that your only job is copying papers. Are you sure you are going there?", "F: You'll be working alone and organize all the files. That's hard, isn't it, darling?", "F: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t understand. Could you repeat a little louder, please?", "F: If your main work is keeping the trash cleared up as you said, it's meaningless, dad."], "article": "F: Well, you must be happy, Nathan you're almost ready to go to Chicago for your practice. We're sure going to miss you around here. M: I'll miss you too, mom. But yeah, I'm excited about my summer. And don't be too sad. I'll be back in a few months, in time for the first day of school. By winter break, you'll hardly remember I was even gone. F: So how do you think you'll do in the big city? Are you worried about working for a big newspaper like the Chicago Tribune? M: Not really. I'm not afraid of hard work and I know how to organize my day. I think I'll do a good job. F: But doing for practice isn't just for the company to profit, is it? It's also for you to get experience. Do you even know what you'll be doing? M: I'm not worried about that. I've got a lot of natural curiosity. And I'm very social, I'm sure I'll learn from all the other people there. F: What if they stick you in some backroom by yourself just copying papers or taking out the trash? M: I don't think that will happen. They asked for someone who was good at editing, organizing computer files and keeping track of deadlines. And I already know who I'll be working with, one of their regular writers.", "id": "train_3996"}
