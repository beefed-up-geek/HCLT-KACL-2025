Tim, tell us all about it. M: Well, I'm lucky to have such a great job. Basically, young musicians come from all over the world and learn to play together to have a concert tour. By the end of the eight week course, they're really good. And hearing them play is what gives me most pleasure. Unfortunately, I don't get to know them all that well, as organizing every single small thing of the course keeps me busy. F: So how do you find the young musicians? M: We advertise online. Anyone between the ages of 16 and 20 can complete the application form and email it to us. We're not looking for perfect performance or the good looking stars of tomorrow.
