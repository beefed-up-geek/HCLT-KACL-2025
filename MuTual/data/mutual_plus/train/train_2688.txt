Could you repeat a little louder, please?", "F: Yeah, anyone who joins the camp should take a map of the world.", "F: Exactly, you need to take pictures to the camp which will be held next year."], "article": "F: Hi, there. On last week's program, we interviewed the man behind the idea of the international camps. So I thought that this week, you'd be interested to hear more about one of the camps which will be held later this year. Over to you, Michael. M: Thank you. Yes, to apply for the camp, you don't have to be a student. You don't even have to be employed. But you must be able to speak one foreign language. F: OK. What about the camping? M: Well, the camp organizers supply tents which sleep up to 4 people, but you are unlikely to know the people who you'll be sharing a tent with. Because you'll be sharing with people who may not even speak your language. F: Sounds interesting. Who does the cooking in the camp? M: Everybody is expected to help with the running of the camp. That means helping to prepare food, keeping the campsite clean and so on. The camp organizers are looking for people who can get along with others whatever happens. F: And is there anything you need to take? M: As I've said, tents are provided, but you'll need to bring your own pillow, knife and fork. You're also asked to bring along photographs, postcards, anything that shows some of the changes of your own country. Everything goes into an exhibition at the start of the camp. Together with a huge map of the world, showing the different countries people come from.", "id": "train_2688"}
