I hope you can have a nice discussion with your wife. See you tomorrow."], "article": "M: Excuse me, is this the ad department? F: Can I help you? M: Yeah, I want to know how to advertise in your newspaper. F: There are two basics you have to consider about the ad cost? One, how big is your ad? Second, how often do you want it to be in the paper? The bigger and more frequent you ad is, the more it costs. M: OK. Can you tell me what kind I should choose? F: Usually weekend ads are more expensive as more people read the paper then. What do you want to advertise, anyway? M: My wife's new clothes shop. Any recommendation? F: It's helpful if you can tell me your potential customers. For instance, we know what parts of the newspaper are more likely to be read by women and on what days they read them. M: Great. I will ask my wife. She knows lots about her customers. I'll come back tomorrow. Thanks.", "id": "train_793"}
