Could you say it again?", "F: I would also say that your writing is creative, Mike.", "F: I agree that your writing is encouraging. Since you say there will surely be another collections of poetry, I'd expect to see more."], "article": "F: Welcome to this edition of writers. Tonight, we have Steven Darcy with us. Congratulations on your book Life and Everything in Between, Steven. It's such a success. M: Thank you. F: This is your first attempt at poetry? Did you ever try it before? Did you take any classes in poetry? M: Well, my only real experience was writing business plans. Other than that, I have zero experience, where writing is concerned. I have always had a good grasp of English language, thanks to my mom who started me reading when I was very little. F: What is the hardest thing about creating your work? M: Definitely finding the perfect words to fit what I wanted to say. There is always a word or 2 that I might still rewrite if given the chance. F: Will there be more collections of poetry from Darcy? M: There will be more of something that suppose, but maybe not poetry. I really don't see myself as a poet. Rather, I see what I wrote as a kind of writing that might inspire people in some way.", "id": "train_878"}
