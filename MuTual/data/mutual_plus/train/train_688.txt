I'll lead my students to have a try of some Chinese and French accents for fun."], "article": "F: Hong, it seems like you really struggle to learn English, is this level too hard for you? M: I don't know. I think it's just boring. I don't like the workbooks because the lessons talk about baby things. I'm not a little child. I want to learn something more exciting. F: Hmm, I have an idea that you'll like. This week, you can do a special project for class. M: Oh, what's that? F: I want you to watch some YouTube videos of people speaking in different English accents. I'll send you the links for the ones you should watch, they're very funny. One person does about 30 different accents in 10 minutes. M: Wow, that's great, but, won't it be harder for me to learn English if I'm listening to so many different ways of speaking the language? F: It shouldn't, this is just a fun project to help you get more interested in the lessons. There is a more serious side to it, though. I want you to write a one page essay about the videos and tell the class about your project on Friday. You can show some of the videos during your presentation too if you like. I think the whole class will benefit from this.", "id": "train_688"}
