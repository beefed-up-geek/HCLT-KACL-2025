M: Tell me what happened this time? Is it the keyboard again or the mouse? F: Well, the keyboard is ok now, and the mouse is working well, too, even though you suggested that I get a new one last time. Actually the problem is when I was working this morning, the screen suddenly went black. M: Ok, let me have a look. The screen seems to be working, so I'll take a look at the inside of the laptop. Did you save your files? F: No, since I didn't know that the computer would stop working. Please don't tell me I've lost my report. M: I'm afraid so, here's the problem. Something has overheated inside the laptop. F: Can you fix it quickly? M: I'll try. It may take a couple of hours. I'll have to take it back to my shop and fix it. I'll test it before I call you. Can I contact you on your mobile phone? F: Of course, I've learned a lesson today.", "id": "train_1756"}
