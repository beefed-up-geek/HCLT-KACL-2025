My friend was supposed to pick me up from the airport, but she just called me and said she is stuck in traffic downtown so she won't be here right now. It's 11 now, so there is no way I'm going to the restaurant at 11:30 as we planned. I wonder if we could reschedule our appointment to sometime this afternoon? M: Certainly. What about 2:00 o'clock in my office? F: That would be fine. See you then. M: See you.", "id": "train_1829"}
