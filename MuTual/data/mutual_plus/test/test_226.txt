F: Well, if you'd listen to me when I suggested asking someone for directions, we wouldn't have got lost in the first place, would we? M: Oh, go on, blame it all on me. You were the one who was driving when we got stopped by the police. If you hadn't been speeding, we wouldn't have been stopped at all. F: That's not fair.
