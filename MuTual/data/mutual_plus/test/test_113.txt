I asked him to pay me more each month. And can you guess what he said? M: I certainly have no idea. What did he say to make you so angry? F: He said I wasn't good enough for higher pay. I entered the company when I was just 25 years old, and now I'm 30 years old. Shouldn't I get a pay raise? M: I certainly think you should get a pay raise? F: How I wish you were my boss! I told my boss that now I need more money to buy a car to raise my kids, and to buy a house. But he just said no. M: Perhaps he knew I make enough money for everything. Just cheer up, honey. It's not a big deal. Now smile and forget about what happened today. F: OK, but I didn't cook tonight. I wasn't in the mood to do that, you know. M: It's OK. We can eat out with the kids tonight.
