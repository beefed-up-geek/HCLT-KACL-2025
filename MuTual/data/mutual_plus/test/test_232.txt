There are just 2 hours left. Have you finished packing? M: I've almost finished packing. Now I'm waiting for the jacket I lent to David last week. F: Which jacket, the gray one or the blue one? M: Neither, the black one. It's my favorite. I want to wear it to the country because I want to take pictures there. F: Then have you packed your camera in your bag? M: No, few young people use cameras to take pictures now. A cellphone is good enough for taking pictures. F: Well, I prefer to use a Camera, but it's up to you. Then have you put the cookies in your bag? M: No, it's too heavy for me. I want to travel light. F: I made them especially for your grandparents. They love my cookies very much. I'm sure they'll be disappointed if you don't take them with you. I've told them you take the cookies to them. M: All right, I'll take them. F: Good. So when will David get here?
