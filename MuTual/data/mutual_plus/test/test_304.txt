M: Hi I ordered some products from your website a week ago, but they haven't arrived yet although you had told me you would ship them one or 2 days after I placed my order. F: Give me a second Sir to track down your order. Yes, here it is. The products were shipped on September nineteenth. That's a day after you place your order. The shipping number is 3356 and the delivery company is BLC. M: OK, I'll try contacting them to find out what's taking them so long to deliver the package. Thanks a lot. F: You're welcome, Sir. If you have any questions, please call me again.", "id": "test_304"}
