I was just wondering if you want to go out tonight? M: Well, I was thinking about reading a book at home tonight. What exactly have you got in mind? F: I thought we could just go for a walk. Maybe down to the bridge. M: Sorry, but I worked out in the gym this afternoon. I don't feel like going for a walk tonight. F: Oh, then let's go to the cinema. There is a new movie playing in theaters. How about going to see it? M: Sounds great. What time does it start? F: At 8:20. What about having supper together before going to the movie? M: Sorry. But my mother will make chicken and potatoes tonight, which are my favorite. So I'd rather eat at home and then go to the cinema.
