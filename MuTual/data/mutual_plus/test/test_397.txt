By next week, I'll be living in the Big Apple. M: New York. Why? I thought you loved the West Coast. F: I do. It's beautiful and the weather is perfect, but I'm trying to make it as a singer and it's impossible here. All of the music clubs here have closed down in the last few years. M: Do you know why? F: Yeah, as housing prices have gone up, clubs have been torn down to build new apartments. M: That's true. Now the only places to go in San Francisco are fancy restaurants. F: Yeah, so there isn't anywhere to perform. M: OK, but won't your family miss you? F: I only have a brother here. Most of my family is actually in Philadelphia. I'll be much closer to them once I move. M: Isn't it expensive in New York? F: It is, but San Francisco has also become quite expensive in the past few years. My rent will be about the same. M: Wow. Well. Are you sure you'll be able to find places to perform? F: Yes, I've actually scheduled a performance already and it's important that I do not waste anytime. I'm 26 years old and I need to make a name for myself in the next 4 years.", "id": "test_397"}
