M: We started talking and I completely forgot about the chips. After the call. I just went back to my living room. F: Oh no. M: Yes, I watch TV for about 20 minutes and the next thing I knew there was the smell of smoke in someone was shouting fire fire. I immediately realized it was my chips. I rushed out of the room. The kitchen was next door. Well, there were flames all over one wall. F: What did you do? M: Well, I grabbed some blankets from my bed and ran to the kitchen to throw them over the flames. By that time, my neighbors had already called the fire Department. The firefighters arrived, I think within about 10 minutes and put the fire out very quickly. F: So what was the damage. M: Well.
