I have to run to the airport and pick up my mother. My father called just a minute ago to let me know. M: No problem. Your mother is a professor right? F: Yes. That's right. You have a good memory. She's coming to give a lecture on language teaching in the New York University Library at 5:00 PM this Friday. Thanks very much for taking my class, I was going to start the students on a new lesson, lesson 13. You can teach it however you like. M: Great, by the way I'd love to attend your mom's lecture since she's quite an expert in language teaching. I don't have any classes after 3:00 PM on weekdays, so do you mind if I go with you?", "id": "test_38"}
