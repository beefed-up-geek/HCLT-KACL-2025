M: Yes, actually. Believe it or not, Mandy and I are getting married. F: It's great. Congratulations. When did you decide? M: Only last week. It was when we were staying with her family in Schottland. Now we're trying to find a suitable flat. F: It will be great to have you as neighbors. I hope you manage to buy one soon. M: We aren't looking for one to buy. We don't have enough money yet. We want to find somewhere to rent. F: Yes, of course, that's what we did at first. In fact, in the end my brother lent us some money. That's how we managed to buy ours. M: Really? Perhaps I'll talk to my family about it. Now, what about a coffee?
