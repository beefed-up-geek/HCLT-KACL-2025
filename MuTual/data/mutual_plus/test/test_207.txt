I'm very envious of the people who were married."], "article": "M: How do you usually get to work in the morning? F: I try to ride my bike most of the time. Of course, when I'm running late, I take the subway. M: I always seem to be 5 or 10 minutes late for everything. I drive to work everyday. So if the traffic is bad, I have to think of a new way to apologize to my boss for being late. F: Does your boss yell at you if you're late? M: No, not really. He knows that I live far away. I stay late whenever I don't make it on time in the morning and it probably helps that I earned a fair amount of money for the company year after year. F: Have you ever considered moving into the city to be closer to your job? M: To be honest, I would rather change jobs than houses. My wife loves our house, especially since she works from home. Our kids are in great schools. And on the weekends, there are a million things for us to do as a family. F: It does sound nice. For me, though, I love living in the city. There are so many cultural activities and I love not having to drive. M: Yeah, driving is pretty stressful sometimes. F: I think it's also easier to live in the city when you don't have kids. If I were a mom, I probably live closer to you. M: Well, you and Timothy might want to think about getting started with that.", "id": "test_207"}
