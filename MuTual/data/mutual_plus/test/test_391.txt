F: Yes, it's me. You look familiar. Were you there in my class then? M: Yes, sure. I'm so glad I took your lecture and I've benefited quite a lot from it. F: Thanks. It's also rewarding for me to do something meaningful in my spare time. M: Oh, I thought you were a IT engineer or something like an expert in this profession. F: Not exactly, but I know a bit about computer. M: I thought that it would be impossible for me to learn how to use a computer at my age, but now I'm exchanging emails with my grandchildren.
