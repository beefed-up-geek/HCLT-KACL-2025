M: Migrate went down recently, so I am very anxious. F: Oh really? M: Yeah, but I know you always do well in your studies. Could you tell me how you do it? F: In fact, I don't think I have any special methods. I just like discussing things with my classmates. M: Well, now I think discussions are great. Everybody can express his own opinion and learn from each other. Meanwhile, they also help us build our confidence and have courage to express our opinions. F: You're right, but you could also be influenced by others in a bad way. You have to decide whether these kinds of discussions are suitable for you and whether they would be useful for your studies. I also like reading books. M: Yeah, that is a good method. But I just don't like reading very much. Maybe that's why I'm not doing very well in my studies.", "id": "test_457"}
