What were you guys doing, William? M: Our music club held an activity in the shopping center then. F: What activity? You didn't tell us anything about it. M: So sorry. I should have told mom and dad and you last night. But I was afraid I would be too nervous to play well if they went there. Mrs. Smith took us there. She has been preparing us for this free performance for a month. F: It's OK? What did you do then? M: In the beginning, we all walked in the shopping center like we were shopping there. A few minutes later, one of our members began to play the violin in the center on the first floor. With that music, we all quickly gathered there one by one and joined to play. F: You mean you held the performance among passers-by? M: Yes, we played 4 pieces of music in total. So many people stood around us and recorded it with their cameras and cell phones. F: You did well. Your performance is very meaningful.", "id": "test_168"}
