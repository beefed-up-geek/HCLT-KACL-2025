What a surprise to run into you here! Are you shopping here? F: Yes, I need to go to a party tomorrow night. But I don't know what to wear, so I came downtown to buy a dress. Are you shopping here, too? M: No, I'm here to pick up my mother. She's meeting, a friend here. By the way, I heard you have a new job now. So how's your new job going? F: Eeally well, thanks. My colleagues are really nice. Though my boss is a bit strict, he's nice too, different from my former boss. He isn't bossy at all. M: Do you miss your old coworkers? F: Of course. I worked with them for 5 years and we got along well, but I just couldn't stay there any longer. I have a family to support, you know. I didn't really make much there. Well, let's stop talking about me. So how's your job going? M: Not so well. Now I have to work in groups with people from different departments. I'm not very good at teamwork.
