How was the boy hurt?"], "article": "F: Who wrote this? It's completely wrong. M: What do you mean? F: Just look at it. The accident wasn't on Thursday. It was on Tuesday. The accident happened at lunch time. Really you should remember the fact. It was a girl not a boy lying on the road and she hadn't tripped over anything. She had just slipped because the road was wet from the rain. M: OK. Everything about the truck and car is right. F: I don't believe you. Why do you think there was a truck? M: Well, the article says so. F: Don't believe everything you read. It was a mini bus and the mini bus driver was fine. The person who flew out was a passenger at the front of the minibus. M: So it should be bad news for a passenger on the minibus and I guess the information about the car is correct. F: It is, but I think that is personal information and we shouldn't printed in the newspaper so cancel the entire paragraph.", "id": "test_460"}
