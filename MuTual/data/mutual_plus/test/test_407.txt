Could you repeat a little louder, please?", "F: It must be like a miracle seeing the birds. I would also treasure such memory."], "article": "F: Good morning, everyone. In the studio today we have Steve Jackson, who's going to tell us about his recent trip to the Antarctic. So Steve, what was it like? Did you freeze? M: No, I didn't. While I was there, the temperature was about 7 degrees and I found it quite comfortable. It can get storming in the Antarctic but the seas were calm. F: I guess you should take warm clothes. M: Well, you really need that. But what I found most useful was dark sunglasses. The sun can get really strong with the reflection of the snow and the ice. F: What were the other passengers like? M: All the atmosphere aboard the ship was great. The crews were mainly American and they did their best to get everyone to mix. F: Did you come across any people apart from your fellow tourists? M: Yes, a few of the scientists at a research station. They gave his coffee and biscuits one morning. F: What's your best memory of the trip? M: Hard to say really. There are so many. We saw a lot of wildlife, but I guess what I most treasured is the large variety of birds we saw.", "id": "test_407"}
