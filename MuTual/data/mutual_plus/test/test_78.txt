M: Hi Nancy, I work very hard, I get results. I do much more than I really should and nobody notices anyway, I didn't get the promotion this time. F: Frank I think you need talk with the boss. At least ask for a pay rise or something. M: You know, I get nervous even before entering his office. F: There is no need to be afraid when you claim something you deserve. I know better than anyone else of how good an employee you are. If it wasn't for you getting that $2,000,000 deal last month, we would all be at home looking for new jobs now. You need to let the boss see that too. M: Well. I just can't. F: How about this? Next week I will invite all the colleagues to my birthday party. Our boss will be there, too.
