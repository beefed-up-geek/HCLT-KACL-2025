We've talked about this before, and have chosen 2 possibilities. A trip across Canada or explore Florida, which will it be? F: I'd like to go to Florida. I've always wanted to visit Orlando. M: We should get on the internet and check flight schedules as soon as possible. I remember a ticket costs $500. They may still have that promotion where a second person flies for half price. That means the four of us can go for the cost of 3. F: Orlando here we come, but we won't spend the whole 2 weeks there, will we? I heard Saint Augustine was cool and there's Daytona Beach, where you can drive on the beach. M: Your mother and I will take care of the driving and make hotel reservations. So you and Tim will plan the sightseeing. Is that a deal? F: Yeah, great.", "id": "test_72"}
