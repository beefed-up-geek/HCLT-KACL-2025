F: How long does it take you to come here? M: It depends. If I ride my bike, it will take me about 50 minutes. F: How about taking the bus? M: If I am lucky, I will spend only half an hour on my way. But if it is not my day, it will take almost an hour. F: That really wastes a lot of time. Why don't you move to a neighborhood closer to our company? M: It is a little far from downtown. F: But you will not be late that off in this way. And there is a supermarket near our company. You can buy food or clothes there after work. It is convenient. M: Well, that might be a way.
