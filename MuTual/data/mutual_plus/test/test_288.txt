It is so disappointing. I thought you'd have bought me a new one. M: Don't be so angry my darling, I wanted to buy a new car for you, but I haven't got enough money at the moment. So when I got to the car market, I changed my mind. F: I feel so ashamed to drive such an old car. You know all my friends have good cars and beautiful houses. I really envy them. M: I am sorry for that. Please forgive me, I can promise you that if my business grows better for 3 more years, I'll surely make a fortune, then I'll buy you the most expensive car and a beautiful house with a nice, big garden and in the garden, there will be a fountain and a swimming pool.
