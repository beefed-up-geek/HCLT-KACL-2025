Welcome back. How was your trip to the United States? F: Very busy. I had a lot of meetings and met the business partners, so of course I didn't have much time to see New York. M: What a pity. Actually I'm going on a trip there myself next week. F: Really? Then take my advice. Do the well being in the air program. It really works. M: Oh, I read about that in a magazine. You say it works? F: Yes, I did the program on my flight to the States and when I arrived in New York, I felt fresh and energetic. On the way back, I didn't do it and I felt terrible. M: You're choking. F: Not at all. It really meant a world of difference. M: Huh. So what did you do? F: Well, I didn't drink any alcohol or coffee and I didn't eat any meat or rich food. I drank a lot of water and fresh tooth and I ate the noodles on the special well being menu. They're lighter and they contain fish and vegetables. And I did some of the exercises that the program recommends like walking around the plane and stretching.", "id": "test_453"}
