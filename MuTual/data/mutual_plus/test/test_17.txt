M: Yes, there on the left next to the purses, but don't you think you should look for something uh a bit more mature? F: Oh no it's not for me, I'm looking for a present for my niece. She's turning 16 next week and she's having a big party. M: Oh, I remember when my daughter was that age, she's about to graduate college now. F: How wonderful. Yeah, Elizabeth is looking at schools right now, will probably take her on a tour of the East Coast colleges sometime in the fall. She lives with my brother and his wife in Oregon. M: There are some schools there that offer good programs, but they probably don't get the scenery like we do here on the East Coast. I've always like seeing the seasons change. I went to the university of Pennsylvania. What about you? F: I went to Brown University. M: Great. So where does your niece want to go to school? F: Oh, I think Harvard, Yale and the University of Chicago are her top three choices. M: Well, those are all fantastic schools with a long history, but I think it's a good idea to take her to see all those places up close. And in person you can't get a sense of a college until you set would on campus. F: I couldn't agree more. Well, I'd better get back to my shopping.", "id": "test_17"}
